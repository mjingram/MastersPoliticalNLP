       "'(CNN) Oil prices are spiking following the attacks this weekend that disrupted about half of Saudi Arabia\\'s oil capacity. That accounts for about 5% of the daily global oil supply, and is the biggest oil disruption in history .\\n\\nThe market reaction would likely have been much greater were it not for the substantial increase in US crude production over the past decade. From 2008 to 2018, US crude oil production more than doubled, from 5 million barrels a day to almost 11 million barrels a day, according to the Energy Information Agency.\\n\\nMuch of that increase has been the result of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. By some estimates, fracked oil wells accounted for more than half of US oil production in 2018.\\n\\nMany 2020 Democratic contenders support a ban on fracking. Recently, two of the top three, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have suggested that as president they would work to ban fracking in the US.\\n\\nBeyond the market implications that such a move would have, it raises obvious political and legal questions, chief among them: Does the President actually have the authority to ban fracking?\\n\\nFacts First: Without an act of Congress, the President could not issue an outright ban on fracking across the US. There are however a number of regulatory and executive actions an administration could take to prevent or shrink the use of fracking technology, particularly on federal land. The problem is that most fracking takes place on private land, and any attempts to limit it would likely face legal challenges.\\n\\nOn Sept. 4, Sanders wrote that \"any proposal to avert the climate crisis must include a full fracking ban on public and private lands.\"\\n\\nTwo days later, Warren struck a similar note, tweeting Sept. 6 that on day one of her presidency she would \"sign an executive order that puts a total moratorium on all new fossil fuel leases for drilling offshore and on public lands. And I will ban fracking—everywhere.\"\\n\\nFirst, a few facts about fracking:\\n\\nFracking is a controversial method of drilling that involves shooting high pressure water, sand and other compounds underground to make small fractures in rock to release oil and gas. While the practice has led to a drilling boom in the US, it\\'s not been without controversy. Specifically, there have been questions about the effect it has on drinking water, and methane emissions, and it\\'s even been tied to a rise in earthquakes.\\n\\nThe US Geological Survey determined that a few earthquakes in Oklahoma have been linked to fracking-related practices -- specifically from the disposal of wastewater -- and the EPA \"found scientific evidence that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances.\"\\n\\nThat, along with rising public concern over the climate crisis, has made fracking a particular target of environmentalists and politicians.\\n\\nBut how far could a president go in simply banning the practice? According to experts, any efforts could present a rocky road of legal challenges.\\n\\n\"A President can\\'t unilaterally ban fracking on private lands,\" says Christopher Guith, senior VP of the US Chamber of Commerce\\'s Global Energy Institute, \"but a motivated President could embark on a regulatory agenda that would make fracking economically impossible.\"\\n\\nGuith noted that these tactics would face a great deal of legal challenges from states, businesses and local governments. That\\'s essentially what happened under President Barack Obama, whose administration attempted to increase regulations on fracking, and yet was largely thwarted in the courts.\\n\\nIn 2015, the federal government issued a series of fracking regulations through the Bureau of Land Management that were meant to protect water resources and force companies to disclose the chemicals used in fracking.\\n\\nWyoming and Colorado filed petitions for judicial review on the new rules and in 2016 a federal district court judge held that the administration\\'s regulations were unlawful. According to the opinion on the case by Judge Scott Skavdahl, the court found \"that the Bureau of Land Management lacked Congressional authority to promulgate the regulations.\"\\n\\nThis story might repeat itself if an administration tried to reinterpret countless federal regulations in, for instance, the Safe Drinking Water Act or the Underground Injection Control programs -- which regulate, among other things, the disposal of wastewater from fracking -- to try and curb fracking on private land.\\n\\nSo how would these candidates look to thwart fracking?\\n\\nWarren\\'s campaign suggested she would focus on getting a bill through Congress, though that would be difficult if the Republicans maintain their majority in the Senate.\\n\\n\"Elizabeth will fight for legislation to ban fracking nationwide,\" Saloni Sharma, Warren\\'s deputy national press secretary, told CNN. \"She\\'ll build on the Obama administration\\'s methane rule and use executive authorities to regulate contaminants to our air and water as a result of fracking and other natural gas operations.\"\\n\\nSanders\\' plan would take similar actions, using rules and regulations -- among other tactics -- like the Clean Air Act and the Safe Water Act to work toward eliminating fracking, his campaign says.\\n\\nAn anti-fracking administration could also try to pass new regulations at the EPA that would make fracking less economically feasible, like the Obama administration tried to do with coal. Yet, without the help of Congress, that route would likely run into similar problems.\\n\\nAfter a cap-and-trade bill died in the Senate following passage in the House in 2009, the Obama administration tried to limit greenhouse gas emissions through the EPA and its 2014 Clean Power Plan.\\n\\nThe plan, however, was immediately met with lawsuits and never took effect . The EPA received a halt order from the Supreme Court in 2016 until a lower court had ruled on it. Eventually the Trump administration repealed the Clean Power Plan while the case was still bouncing around in the courts.\\n\\nIn order to prevent fracking on US private lands, a Warren or Sanders administration would likely have to work through regulatory powers which would ultimately face a myriad of legal challenges. Or they could try their luck in working with Congress to pass new laws on fracking. Any federal regulations, however, would likely be undone by a future administration who supports or is not as hostile toward fracking.'"

       "  'text': 'The Democrats running for president who quickly called for Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s impeachment over the weekend aren’t backing down – despite The New York Times issuing a major revision to its blockbuster story that ignited the demands in the first place.\\n\\nFor the most part, those candidates are not even acknowledging the story update.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Rep. Jerry Nadler, the Democratic leader of the House Judiciary Committee, seemed to brush off his party\\'s calls to begin proceedings against Kavanaugh, saying on a radio show Monday: \"We have our hands full with impeaching the president right now.”\\n\\nNYT UPDATES KAVANAUGH \\'BOMBSHELL\\' TO NOTE ACCUSER DOESN\\'T RECALL ALLEGED ASSAULT\\n\\nMany of the major 2020 Democratic candidates for president over the weekend released statements calling for Congress to impeach Kavanaugh, citing the Times\\' reporting of an uncorroborated and disputed college-era allegation of sexual misconduct as a reason to impeach.\\n\\nBut late Sunday, the paper revised its portrayed blockbuster story to include the fact that several friends of the alleged victim said she told them she did not recall the reported sexual assault in question.\\n\\nBut that didn’t prompt Democrats to revise or walk back their calls: In one case, billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer called for impeachment proceedings even after the Times’ update.\\n\\n“If the only way to get the truth is to launch an impeachment process for Justice Kavanaugh, I support starting that process immediately,” Steyer said Monday.\\n\\nFox News has reached out to the Democrats who called for impeachment over the weekend to ask if the candidates have changed their position in light of the newspaper’s editors\\' note. None have responded yet.\\n\\nTRUMP SAYS KAVANAUGH BEING \\'ASSAULTED,\\' JUDICIAL RECORD UNDER ATTACK WITH DISPUTED ALLEGATION\\n\\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris – who said over the weekend that Kavanaugh “must be impeached – did not back down in a new tweet Monday, saying, “The reality of Kavanaugh\\'s confirmation process is that it lacked any integrity — there has never been a meaningful investigation into these allegations. We need the truth.”\\n\\nThe Times piece by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, adapted from their forthcoming book, asserted that a Kavanaugh classmate, Clinton-connected nonprofit CEO Max Stier, \"saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\"\\n\\nThe Times did not mention Stier\\'s work as a Clinton defense attorney, or his legal battles with Kavanaugh during the Whitewater investigation. According to the Times, Stier \"notified senators and the FBI about this account\" last year during the Kavanaugh hearings, \"but the FBI did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly.\"\\n\\nHowever, the Times\\' article also initially did not mention that Pogrebin and Kelly\\'s book found that the female student in question did not recall the alleged episode.\\n\\nIn its update, the paper later said, “Editors\\' Note: An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book\\'s account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.\"\\n\\nStill, the earlier reporting ignited an avalanche of impeachment calls.\\n\\nFormer HUD Secretary Julian Castro tweeted: \"It’s more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath. He should be impeached. And Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter.\"\\n\\nSaid Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren: \"Last year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him. Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached.\"\\n\\nKAVANAUGH \\'MUST BE IMPEACHED,\\' TOP DEMS SAY, AS UNCORROBORATED ALLEGATION RESURFACES\\n\\nFormer Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke said: “Yesterday, we learned of another accusation against Brett Kavanaugh—one we didn\\'t find out about before he was confirmed because the Senate forced the FBI to rush its investigation to save his nomination. We know he lied under oath. He should be impeached.\"\\n\\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., tweeted in part, \"This new allegation and additional corroborating evidence adds to a long list of reasons why Brett Kavanaugh should not be a Supreme Court justice. I stand with survivors and countless other Americans in calling for impeachment proceedings to begin.\"\\n\\nSouth Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said: “Kavanaugh should resign and if he doesn’t, the House should impeach him.”\\n\\nOn Capitol Hill, the news prompted outrage from Democrats, but whether that could translate into another dramatic investigation remains to be seen.\\n\\nIn his interview with the \"Brian Lehrer Show\" on Monday, Nadler suggested his committee is more focused on impeaching the president. But he signaled openness to at least reviewing allegations against Kavanaugh. Pressed by the host, Nadler ripped the FBI’s investigation of the allegations as a “sham” and said: \"It might fall under our jurisdiction. We\\'d have to take a look at that.”\\n\\nOthers on the campaign trail raised concerns about Kavanaugh but didn’t explicitly call for impeachment.\\n\\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden said: “This weekend’s report in the New York Times raises again profoundly troubling questions about the integrity of the confirmation process that put Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court in the first place.”\\n\\nSen. Bernie Sanders said he backed going after Kavanaugh by any legal means available: \"The revelations today confirm what we already knew: During his hearing, Kavanaugh faced credible accusations and likely lied to Congress. I support any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold him accountable.\"\\n\\nSen. Amy Klobuchar stopped short of calling for impeachment, and instead posted a picture of Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford with the words, \"Let us never forget what courage looks like.\"\\n\\nCARRIE SEVERINO CALLS OUT NEW YORK TIMES\\' \\'SHAMEFUL ATTEMPT TO REIGNITE SMEARS\\' AGAINST KAVANAUGH\\n\\nConservatives have ripped into Democrats for their calls:\\n\\n\"This is the weakest of the weak type of allegations. It\\'s really a shameful attempt to reignite these smears against Judge Kavanaugh that are utterly baseless,\" Carrie Severino, the founder of the Judicial Crisis Network who recently wrote a sympathetic book about Kavanaugh, said on \"Fox & Friends.\"\\n\\nTrump, for his part, suggested Sunday that Kavanaugh should sue for defamation.\\n\\nStill, other Democrats ramped up their criticism of Kavanaugh on Monday.\\n\\n“It is unsurprising that Kavanaugh, credibly accused of sexual assault, would lie under oath to secure a Supreme Court seat,” tweeted New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “Because sexual assault isn’t a crime of passion - it’s about the abuse of power. He must be impeached.”\\n\\nFox News’ Gregg Re contributed to this report.',\n",

We need the truth.”\\n\\nThe Times piece by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, adapted from their forthcoming book, asserted that a Kavanaugh classmate, Clinton-connected nonprofit CEO Max Stier, \"saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\"\\n\\nThe Times did not mention Stier\\'s work as a Clinton defense attorney, or his legal battles with Kavanaugh during the Whitewater investigation. According to the Times, Stier \"notified senators and the FBI about this account\" last year during the Kavanaugh hearings, \"but the FBI did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly.\"\\n\\nHowever, the Times\\' article also initially did not mention that Pogrebin and Kelly\\'s book found that the female student in question did not recall the alleged episode.\\n\\nIn its update, the paper later said, “Editors\\' Note: An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book\\'s account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.\"\\n\\nStill, the earlier reporting ignited an avalanche of impeachment calls.\\n\\nFormer HUD Secretary Julian Castro tweeted: \"It’s more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath. He should be impeached. And Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter.\"\\n\\nSaid Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren: \"Last year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him. Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached.\"\\n\\nKAVANAUGH \\'MUST BE IMPEACHED,\\' TOP DEMS SAY, AS UNCORROBORATED ALLEGATION RESURFACES\\n\\nFormer Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke said: “Yesterday, we learned of another accusation against Brett Kavanaugh—one we didn\\'t find out about before he was confirmed because the Senate forced the FBI to rush its investigation to save his nomination. We know he lied under oath. He should be impeached.\"\\n\\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., tweeted in part, \"This new allegation and additional corroborating evidence adds to a long list of reasons why Brett Kavanaugh should not be a Supreme Court justice. I stand with survivors and countless other Americans in calling for impeachment proceedings to begin.\"\\n\\nSouth Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said: “Kavanaugh should resign and if he doesn’t, the House should impeach him.”\\n\\nOn Capitol Hill, the news prompted outrage from Democrats, but whether that could translate into another dramatic investigation remains to be seen.\\n\\nIn his interview with the \"Brian Lehrer Show\" on Monday, Nadler suggested his committee is more focused on impeaching the president. But he signaled openness to at least reviewing allegations against Kavanaugh. Pressed by the host, Nadler ripped the FBI’s investigation of the allegations as a “sham” and said: \"It might fall under our jurisdiction. We\\'d have to take a look at that.”\\n\\nOthers on the campaign trail raised concerns about Kavanaugh but didn’t explicitly call for impeachment.\\n\\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden said: “This weekend’s report in the New York Times raises again profoundly troubling questions about the integrity of the confirmation process that put Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court in the first place.”\\n\\nSen. Bernie Sanders said he backed going after Kavanaugh by any legal means available: \"The revelations today confirm what we already knew: During his hearing, Kavanaugh faced credible accusations and likely lied to Congress. I support any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold him accountable.\"\\n\\nSen. Amy Klobuchar stopped short of calling for impeachment, and instead posted a picture of Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford with the words, \"Let us never forget what courage looks like.\"\\n\\nCARRIE SEVERINO CALLS OUT NEW YORK TIMES\\' \\'SHAMEFUL ATTEMPT TO REIGNITE SMEARS\\' AGAINST KAVANAUGH\\n\\nConservatives have ripped into Democrats for their calls:\\n\\n\"This is the weakest of the weak type of allegations. It\\'s really a shameful attempt to reignite these smears against Judge Kavanaugh that are utterly baseless,\" Carrie Severino, the founder of the Judicial Crisis Network who recently wrote a sympathetic book about Kavanaugh, said on \"Fox & Friends.\"\\n\\nTrump, for his part, suggested Sunday that Kavanaugh should sue for defamation.\\n\\nStill, other Democrats ramped up their criticism of Kavanaugh on Monday.\\n\\n“It is unsurprising that Kavanaugh, credibly accused of sexual assault, would lie under oath to secure a Supreme Court seat,” tweeted New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “Because sexual assault isn’t a crime of passion - it’s about the abuse of power. He must be impeached.”\\n\\nFox News’ Gregg Re contributed to this report.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The Justice Department, in new court filings, sought to block congressional Democrats\\' bid for secret grand jury material from the Robert Mueller investigation by citing the confusion inside the caucus over whether or not they\\'re pursuing an \"impeachment investigation.\"\\n\\nIn the Friday court filing, the DOJ argued that the House Judiciary Committee clearly is not.\\n\\nHOUSE DEMS MOVE ON IMPEACHMENT\\n\\n“The committee’s own description of its investigation makes clear that it is too far removed from any potential judicial proceeding to qualify,” the DOJ said.\\n\\nAfter muddled messaging on the matter, committee Democrats last week argued that they are leading an impeachment investigation, as the panel took its first formal vote establishing the procedures for those proceedings and hearings.\\n\\nThe lawmakers, in a related case in court, are seeking the release of secret grand jury material from Mueller’s investigation. A small percentage of the report remains redacted, as grand jury material must remain secret according to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, with narrow exceptions. But in a recent court filing, the committee claimed their investigation of Trump’s possible wrongdoing falls under the exception for judicial proceedings, including impeachment proceedings.\\n\\nBut the DOJ countered that what Democrats are doing is hardly such an investigation.\\n\\nKAVANAUGH \\'MUST BE IMPEACHED,\\' TOP DEMS SAY, AS UNCORROBORATED ALLEGATION RESURFACES\\n\\nThe DOJ also quoted House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., as once saying, “[a]n impeachment inquiry is when you consider only impeachment. That’s not what we’re doing.” Since then, Nadler has gone back and forth over whether or not his committee’s investigation is indeed an “impeachment inquiry.”\\n\\nThe developments come as President Trump on Monday accused the committee of botching their efforts. He then referred them to former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama’s deal with Netflix, and the Obamas’ book deal from 2017, as well as other deals made by lawmakers.\\n\\nMCCARTHY PROMISES ACCOUNTABILITY AS BARR REVIEWS IG\\'S FISA REPORT: \\'THE CLOSEST WE\\'VE EVER SEEN TO A COUP’\\n\\n“House Judiciary has given up on the Mueller Report, sadly for them after two years and $40,000,000 spent - ZERO COLLUSION, ZERO OBSTRUCTION. So they say, OK, lets look at everything else, and all of the deals that ‘Trump’ has done over his lifetime. But it doesn’t work that way,” Trump tweeted Monday. “I have a better idea. Look at the Obama Book Deal, or the ridiculous Netflix deal. Then look at all the deals made by the Dems in Congress, the ‘Congressional Slush Fund,’ and lastly the IG Reports. Take a look at them. Those investigations would be over FAST!\\n\\nThe IG reports include recently released findings that former FBI Director James Comey violated policies with his handling of memos documenting conversations with Trump -- leaked to help bring about the appointment of a special counsel for the investigation of Trump campaign ties to Russian election interference efforts. Another report, expected to be released in the near future, will discuss whether the FBI acted improperly with regard to FISA warrant applications to conduct surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page during the early stages of the Russia probe. DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz turned over a draft of his findings to Attorney General Bill Barr last week.\\n\\nAs for the Obamas, this isn’t the first time Trump implied that their book deal with Penguin Random House – which reportedly paid the former president and first lady more than $65 million for their memoirs – involved wrongdoing.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n“We want to find out what happened with the last Democrat president,” Trump said in July. “Let’s look into Obama the way they’ve looked at me. From day one they’ve looked into everything that we’ve done. They could look into the book deal that President Obama made. Let’s subpoena all of his records.” The president did not elaborate on what such an investigation might find.\\n\\nThe \"Congressional Slush Fund\" Trump referred to is a Treasury Department fund that was used to pay millions of dollars in settlements to sexual harassment accusers.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Facing discontent and unheeded warnings from longtime supporters that he could lose the New Hampshire primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont on Sunday replaced the director of his presidential campaign operations in the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House\\n\\nThe campaign broke the news on Sunday to more than 40 members of Sanders’ steering committee. The campaign announced that Joe Caiazzo was being replaced as state director.\\n\\nShannon Jackson, who made the announcement, will replace him. Jackson ran Sanders’ 2018 Senate re-election campaign and was a senior adviser on the independent senator’s 2016 White House bid as well as the current campaign.\\n\\nSANDERS AND WARREN AVOID ATTACKS DURING DUELING EVENTS IN \\'MUST WIN\\' NEW HAMPSHIRE\\n\\n“Thank God the campaign finally figured out they had to make serious changes in New Hampshire,” a longtime Sanders backer who attended the meeting told Fox News.\\n\\nThe move comes as some Sanders supporters in New Hampshire are looking over their shoulders at Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts - the other progressive standard bearer in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential candidates.\\n\\nRecent polls in the state have fluctuated. A live telephone operator survey from the Boston Herald and Franklin Pierce University indicated Sanders at 29 percent, overall front-runner and former Vice President Joe Biden at 21 percent and Elizabeth Warren at 19 percent. But another recent poll suggested a three-way tie between the three top-tier contenders and a third suggested Sanders lagging behind Biden and Warren.\\n\\nSANDERS AHEAD OF BIDEN AND WARREN IN NH IN MOST RECENT NH POLL\\n\\nSanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement on Sunday that \"we’ve built a great team in NH and are in a really strong position there. The campaign is now building out our operations to include Massachusetts and Maine state directors as we increase our focus in Super Tuesday states. We are running a 50 state campaign, taking no state or voters for granted and expanding our operations to secure the Democratic nomination.\"\\n\\nCaiazzo was moved to one of those Super Tuesday states – Massachusetts. Caiazzo served as Sanders campaign’s 2016 state director in both Massachusetts and Rhode Island.\\n\\nBut Shakir’s statement runs counter to what another steering committee member, who also asked for anonymity, emphasized.\\n\\nPointing to the campaign, the supporter said “they didn’t listen to anything the steering committee suggested.” The supporter also lamented that some “Bernie backers” were going to Warren because the campaign “didn’t listen to them.”\\n\\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\\n\\nSanders has repeatedly refrained from calling New Hampshire a “must win” state.\\n\\n“This is obviously a very important state, as is Iowa, South Carolina. We’re working hard. We’re going to do many, many rallies around the state, and I’m feeling pretty good,” he said during a stop in the state on Labor Day.\\n\\nBut, a veteran Granite State-based political scientist said the first primary state’s crucial to both Sanders and Warren.\\n\\n“New Hampshire is a must-win-or-place state for Senators Sanders and Warren,” said Wayne Lesperance, the vice president of academic affairs and a political science professor at New England College. “For both candidates, there is no better home-field advantage in the early states than the Granite State.”\\n\\nSanders trounced Hillary Clinton in the state’s February 2016 Democratic presidential primary, launching the one-time longshot into an epic and marathon battle with the eventual nominee. Sanders’ support and organization in the state stayed very strong, even he ended his first White House bid. His steering committee has met monthly ever since the 2016 general election. But the 2020 race is a very different contest, and Sanders is now facing rivals who are preaching the same progressive policies that he first made mainstream in the Democratic Party four years ago.\\n\\nThe transfer of Caiazzo to Massachusetts and of Jackson to New Hampshire came a day after the campaign parted ways with senior New Hampshire adviser Kurt Ehrenberg.\\n\\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n“From the very beginning there was clear and fundamental disagreement between Mr. Caiazzo and myself on how to run a successful presidential primary campaign in New Hampshire,” Ehrenberg told Fox News on Sunday.\\n\\nEhrenberg, a longtime grassroots and labor organizer, set up the crucial New Hampshire organization for Sanders’ first White House bid from scratch in the spring and summer of 2015.',\n",

But his stop here in Clinton on Tuesday, as part of his bus tour through the state, was the first time Buttigieg reunited with the young supporter.\\n\\n\"This is a very special appearance because I\\'m being reunited with somebody whose story I\\'ve been sharing lately,\" Buttigieg told the audience. \"And I\\'m proud to know that a campaign can help her feel like she can stand up tall and be who she is. Because that means that, long before the first vote is even cast, we are creating that kind of culture of belonging that every one of our supporters can spread, that everyone who is here can go out and spread to others, to let everybody know where you fit.\"\\n\\nBissell said Buttigieg sharing their meeting on the trail has changed her life, too.\\n\\nRead More'"

       "  'text': 'The Democrats running for president who quickly called for Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s impeachment over the weekend aren’t backing down – despite The New York Times issuing a major revision to its blockbuster story that ignited the demands in the first place.\\n\\nFor the most part, those candidates are not even acknowledging the story update.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Rep. Jerry Nadler, the Democratic leader of the House Judiciary Committee, seemed to brush off his party\\'s calls to begin proceedings against Kavanaugh, saying on a radio show Monday: \"We have our hands full with impeaching the president right now.”\\n\\nNYT UPDATES KAVANAUGH \\'BOMBSHELL\\' TO NOTE ACCUSER DOESN\\'T RECALL ALLEGED ASSAULT\\n\\nMany of the major 2020 Democratic candidates for president over the weekend released statements calling for Congress to impeach Kavanaugh, citing the Times\\' reporting of an uncorroborated and disputed college-era allegation of sexual misconduct as a reason to impeach.\\n\\nBut late Sunday, the paper revised its portrayed blockbuster story to include the fact that several friends of the alleged victim said she told them she did not recall the reported sexual assault in question.\\n\\nBut that didn’t prompt Democrats to revise or walk back their calls: In one case, billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer called for impeachment proceedings even after the Times’ update.\\n\\n“If the only way to get the truth is to launch an impeachment process for Justice Kavanaugh, I support starting that process immediately,” Steyer said Monday.\\n\\nFox News has reached out to the Democrats who called for impeachment over the weekend to ask if the candidates have changed their position in light of the newspaper’s editors\\' note. None have responded yet.\\n\\nTRUMP SAYS KAVANAUGH BEING \\'ASSAULTED,\\' JUDICIAL RECORD UNDER ATTACK WITH DISPUTED ALLEGATION\\n\\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris – who said over the weekend that Kavanaugh “must be impeached – did not back down in a new tweet Monday, saying, “The reality of Kavanaugh\\'s confirmation process is that it lacked any integrity — there has never been a meaningful investigation into these allegations. We need the truth.”\\n\\nThe Times piece by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, adapted from their forthcoming book, asserted that a Kavanaugh classmate, Clinton-connected nonprofit CEO Max Stier, \"saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\"\\n\\nThe Times did not mention Stier\\'s work as a Clinton defense attorney, or his legal battles with Kavanaugh during the Whitewater investigation. According to the Times, Stier \"notified senators and the FBI about this account\" last year during the Kavanaugh hearings, \"but the FBI did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly.\"\\n\\nHowever, the Times\\' article also initially did not mention that Pogrebin and Kelly\\'s book found that the female student in question did not recall the alleged episode.\\n\\nIn its update, the paper later said, “Editors\\' Note: An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book\\'s account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.\"\\n\\nStill, the earlier reporting ignited an avalanche of impeachment calls.\\n\\nFormer HUD Secretary Julian Castro tweeted: \"It’s more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath. He should be impeached. And Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter.\"\\n\\nSaid Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren: \"Last year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him. Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached.\"\\n\\nKAVANAUGH \\'MUST BE IMPEACHED,\\' TOP DEMS SAY, AS UNCORROBORATED ALLEGATION RESURFACES\\n\\nFormer Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke said: “Yesterday, we learned of another accusation against Brett Kavanaugh—one we didn\\'t find out about before he was confirmed because the Senate forced the FBI to rush its investigation to save his nomination. We know he lied under oath. He should be impeached.\"\\n\\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., tweeted in part, \"This new allegation and additional corroborating evidence adds to a long list of reasons why Brett Kavanaugh should not be a Supreme Court justice. I stand with survivors and countless other Americans in calling for impeachment proceedings to begin.\"\\n\\nSouth Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said: “Kavanaugh should resign and if he doesn’t, the House should impeach him.”\\n\\nOn Capitol Hill, the news prompted outrage from Democrats, but whether that could translate into another dramatic investigation remains to be seen.\\n\\nIn his interview with the \"Brian Lehrer Show\" on Monday, Nadler suggested his committee is more focused on impeaching the president. But he signaled openness to at least reviewing allegations against Kavanaugh. Pressed by the host, Nadler ripped the FBI’s investigation of the allegations as a “sham” and said: \"It might fall under our jurisdiction. We\\'d have to take a look at that.”\\n\\nOthers on the campaign trail raised concerns about Kavanaugh but didn’t explicitly call for impeachment.\\n\\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden said: “This weekend’s report in the New York Times raises again profoundly troubling questions about the integrity of the confirmation process that put Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court in the first place.”\\n\\nSen. Bernie Sanders said he backed going after Kavanaugh by any legal means available: \"The revelations today confirm what we already knew: During his hearing, Kavanaugh faced credible accusations and likely lied to Congress. I support any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold him accountable.\"\\n\\nSen. Amy Klobuchar stopped short of calling for impeachment, and instead posted a picture of Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford with the words, \"Let us never forget what courage looks like.\"\\n\\nCARRIE SEVERINO CALLS OUT NEW YORK TIMES\\' \\'SHAMEFUL ATTEMPT TO REIGNITE SMEARS\\' AGAINST KAVANAUGH\\n\\nConservatives have ripped into Democrats for their calls:\\n\\n\"This is the weakest of the weak type of allegations. It\\'s really a shameful attempt to reignite these smears against Judge Kavanaugh that are utterly baseless,\" Carrie Severino, the founder of the Judicial Crisis Network who recently wrote a sympathetic book about Kavanaugh, said on \"Fox & Friends.\"\\n\\nTrump, for his part, suggested Sunday that Kavanaugh should sue for defamation.\\n\\nStill, other Democrats ramped up their criticism of Kavanaugh on Monday.\\n\\n“It is unsurprising that Kavanaugh, credibly accused of sexual assault, would lie under oath to secure a Supreme Court seat,” tweeted New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “Because sexual assault isn’t a crime of passion - it’s about the abuse of power. He must be impeached.”\\n\\nFox News’ Gregg Re contributed to this report.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The Justice Department, in new court filings, sought to block congressional Democrats\\' bid for secret grand jury material from the Robert Mueller investigation by citing the confusion inside the caucus over whether or not they\\'re pursuing an \"impeachment investigation.\"\\n\\nIn the Friday court filing, the DOJ argued that the House Judiciary Committee clearly is not.\\n\\nHOUSE DEMS MOVE ON IMPEACHMENT\\n\\n“The committee’s own description of its investigation makes clear that it is too far removed from any potential judicial proceeding to qualify,” the DOJ said.\\n\\nAfter muddled messaging on the matter, committee Democrats last week argued that they are leading an impeachment investigation, as the panel took its first formal vote establishing the procedures for those proceedings and hearings.\\n\\nThe lawmakers, in a related case in court, are seeking the release of secret grand jury material from Mueller’s investigation. A small percentage of the report remains redacted, as grand jury material must remain secret according to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, with narrow exceptions. But in a recent court filing, the committee claimed their investigation of Trump’s possible wrongdoing falls under the exception for judicial proceedings, including impeachment proceedings.\\n\\nBut the DOJ countered that what Democrats are doing is hardly such an investigation.\\n\\nKAVANAUGH \\'MUST BE IMPEACHED,\\' TOP DEMS SAY, AS UNCORROBORATED ALLEGATION RESURFACES\\n\\nThe DOJ also quoted House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., as once saying, “[a]n impeachment inquiry is when you consider only impeachment. That’s not what we’re doing.” Since then, Nadler has gone back and forth over whether or not his committee’s investigation is indeed an “impeachment inquiry.”\\n\\nThe developments come as President Trump on Monday accused the committee of botching their efforts. He then referred them to former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama’s deal with Netflix, and the Obamas’ book deal from 2017, as well as other deals made by lawmakers.\\n\\nMCCARTHY PROMISES ACCOUNTABILITY AS BARR REVIEWS IG\\'S FISA REPORT: \\'THE CLOSEST WE\\'VE EVER SEEN TO A COUP’\\n\\n“House Judiciary has given up on the Mueller Report, sadly for them after two years and $40,000,000 spent - ZERO COLLUSION, ZERO OBSTRUCTION. So they say, OK, lets look at everything else, and all of the deals that ‘Trump’ has done over his lifetime. But it doesn’t work that way,” Trump tweeted Monday. “I have a better idea. Look at the Obama Book Deal, or the ridiculous Netflix deal. Then look at all the deals made by the Dems in Congress, the ‘Congressional Slush Fund,’ and lastly the IG Reports. Take a look at them. Those investigations would be over FAST!\\n\\nThe IG reports include recently released findings that former FBI Director James Comey violated policies with his handling of memos documenting conversations with Trump -- leaked to help bring about the appointment of a special counsel for the investigation of Trump campaign ties to Russian election interference efforts. Another report, expected to be released in the near future, will discuss whether the FBI acted improperly with regard to FISA warrant applications to conduct surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page during the early stages of the Russia probe. DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz turned over a draft of his findings to Attorney General Bill Barr last week.\\n\\nAs for the Obamas, this isn’t the first time Trump implied that their book deal with Penguin Random House – which reportedly paid the former president and first lady more than $65 million for their memoirs – involved wrongdoing.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n“We want to find out what happened with the last Democrat president,” Trump said in July. “Let’s look into Obama the way they’ve looked at me. From day one they’ve looked into everything that we’ve done. They could look into the book deal that President Obama made. Let’s subpoena all of his records.” The president did not elaborate on what such an investigation might find.\\n\\nThe \"Congressional Slush Fund\" Trump referred to is a Treasury Department fund that was used to pay millions of dollars in settlements to sexual harassment accusers.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Facing discontent and unheeded warnings from longtime supporters that he could lose the New Hampshire primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont on Sunday replaced the director of his presidential campaign operations in the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House\\n\\nThe campaign broke the news on Sunday to more than 40 members of Sanders’ steering committee. The campaign announced that Joe Caiazzo was being replaced as state director.\\n\\nShannon Jackson, who made the announcement, will replace him. Jackson ran Sanders’ 2018 Senate re-election campaign and was a senior adviser on the independent senator’s 2016 White House bid as well as the current campaign.\\n\\nSANDERS AND WARREN AVOID ATTACKS DURING DUELING EVENTS IN \\'MUST WIN\\' NEW HAMPSHIRE\\n\\n“Thank God the campaign finally figured out they had to make serious changes in New Hampshire,” a longtime Sanders backer who attended the meeting told Fox News.\\n\\nThe move comes as some Sanders supporters in New Hampshire are looking over their shoulders at Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts - the other progressive standard bearer in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential candidates.\\n\\nRecent polls in the state have fluctuated. A live telephone operator survey from the Boston Herald and Franklin Pierce University indicated Sanders at 29 percent, overall front-runner and former Vice President Joe Biden at 21 percent and Elizabeth Warren at 19 percent. But another recent poll suggested a three-way tie between the three top-tier contenders and a third suggested Sanders lagging behind Biden and Warren.\\n\\nSANDERS AHEAD OF BIDEN AND WARREN IN NH IN MOST RECENT NH POLL\\n\\nSanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement on Sunday that \"we’ve built a great team in NH and are in a really strong position there. The campaign is now building out our operations to include Massachusetts and Maine state directors as we increase our focus in Super Tuesday states. We are running a 50 state campaign, taking no state or voters for granted and expanding our operations to secure the Democratic nomination.\"\\n\\nCaiazzo was moved to one of those Super Tuesday states – Massachusetts. Caiazzo served as Sanders campaign’s 2016 state director in both Massachusetts and Rhode Island.\\n\\nBut Shakir’s statement runs counter to what another steering committee member, who also asked for anonymity, emphasized.\\n\\nPointing to the campaign, the supporter said “they didn’t listen to anything the steering committee suggested.” The supporter also lamented that some “Bernie backers” were going to Warren because the campaign “didn’t listen to them.”\\n\\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\\n\\nSanders has repeatedly refrained from calling New Hampshire a “must win” state.\\n\\n“This is obviously a very important state, as is Iowa, South Carolina. We’re working hard. We’re going to do many, many rallies around the state, and I’m feeling pretty good,” he said during a stop in the state on Labor Day.\\n\\nBut, a veteran Granite State-based political scientist said the first primary state’s crucial to both Sanders and Warren.\\n\\n“New Hampshire is a must-win-or-place state for Senators Sanders and Warren,” said Wayne Lesperance, the vice president of academic affairs and a political science professor at New England College. “For both candidates, there is no better home-field advantage in the early states than the Granite State.”\\n\\nSanders trounced Hillary Clinton in the state’s February 2016 Democratic presidential primary, launching the one-time longshot into an epic and marathon battle with the eventual nominee. Sanders’ support and organization in the state stayed very strong, even he ended his first White House bid. His steering committee has met monthly ever since the 2016 general election. But the 2020 race is a very different contest, and Sanders is now facing rivals who are preaching the same progressive policies that he first made mainstream in the Democratic Party four years ago.\\n\\nThe transfer of Caiazzo to Massachusetts and of Jackson to New Hampshire came a day after the campaign parted ways with senior New Hampshire adviser Kurt Ehrenberg.\\n\\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n“From the very beginning there was clear and fundamental disagreement between Mr. Caiazzo and myself on how to run a successful presidential primary campaign in New Hampshire,” Ehrenberg told Fox News on Sunday.\\n\\nEhrenberg, a longtime grassroots and labor organizer, set up the crucial New Hampshire organization for Sanders’ first White House bid from scratch in the spring and summer of 2015.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Leland Keyser, a friend of Christine Blasey Ford who allegedly was at the party where Ford says Brett Kavanaugh assaulted her decades ago, now says the story \"just didn\\'t make any sense.\"\\n\\nThat revelation is contained in a forthcoming book, by New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, titled \"The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation.\" But the Times omitted any reference to Keyser\\'s comments in a widely panned article this weekend by Pogrebin and Kelly that was adapted from the book.\\n\\nNYT FORCED TO ISSUE EDITORS\\' NOTE, ADDING INFORMATION THAT ALLEGED VICTIM DOESN\\'T EVEN REMEMBER SUPPOSED ASSAULT\\n\\nThe Times\\' article instead included an uncorroborated allegation from a Clinton-linked lawyer claiming Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted a female student, without mentioning that the student did not recall the events in question. The Times later published a major update to include those details, along with an editors\\' note, but not before virtually all major Democratic presidential candidates had called for Kavanaugh\\'s impeachment.\\n\\nSpecifically, Keyser challenged Ford\\'s narrative that sometime in the summer of 1982, Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge assaulted her at a party also attended by Keyser and P.J. Smith.\\n\\n\"I don’t have any confidence in the story,” Keyser told the reporters of Ford\\'s claims, according to outlets that have reviewed advance copies of the forthcoming book.\\n\\n\"Those facts together I don\\'t recollect, and it just didn\\'t make any sense,\" Keyser added.\\n\\n\"Those facts together I don\\'t recollect, and it just didn\\'t make any sense.\" — Leland Keyser\\n\\nFord has been unable to identify exactly where or when the alleged assault occurred, or how she got home after the incident.\\n\\nKeyser reportedly remarked: \"It would be impossible for me to be the only girl at a get-together with three guys, have her leave, and then not figure out how she\\'s getting home.\" Keyser told Pogrebin and Kelly, \"I just really didn\\'t have confidence in the story.\"\\n\\nLast year, Keyser, speaking through her attorney, said she could not corroborate Ford\\'s claims. Keyser told the FBI she felt pressured by partisan activists and Ford\\'s friends to change her account and later revised her statement to indicate that she believed Ford despite her lack of memory of the episode.\\n\\nKeyser\\'s initial statement was that \"Simply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford.”\\n\\nThe revised statement from Keyser\\'s attorney read: \"Ms. Keyser does not refute Dr. Ford\\'s account, and she has already told the press that she believes Dr. Ford\\'s account. However, the simple and unchangeable truth is that she is unable to corroborate it because she has no recollection of the incident in question.”\\n\\n2020 DEMS CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR KAVANAUGH IMPEACHMENT, DESPITE DUD NYT \\'BOMBSHELL\\' GOING BUST\\n\\nThe Times\\' authors, in the book, cast doubt on Keyser\\'s memory, writing that “Keyser’s memory might be affected by her struggles with alcohol and other substances.” Keyser, though, also informed the reporters of an apparent smear campaign directed at her, in an effort to get her to change her story.\\n\\nFord, in her explosive testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last year, indicated that it wasn\\'t surprising Keyser wouldn\\'t remember the episode.\\n\\n\"She didn’t know about the event. She was downstairs during the event and I did not share it with her,” Ford said.\\n\\nFord added: “Leland has significant health challenges, and I’m happy that she’s focusing on herself and getting the health treatment that she needs, and she let me know that she needed her lawyer to take care of this for her, and she texted me right afterward with an apology and good wishes, and et cetera.”\\n\\nRather than mention Keyser\\'s latest remarks, the Times\\' article instead focused on a new accuser mentioned in the book, who was allegedly sexually assaulted by Kavanaugh. But the Times\\' article omitted key details from the book, including that the accuser herself had no recollection of the event.\\n\\nThe Times later published an editors\\' note adding the information, but not before virtually all 2020 Democratic presidential candidates demanded Kavanaugh\\'s\\' impeachment.\\n\\nThroughout the day on Sunday, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Beto O\\'Rourke, Cory Booker and Julian Castro, among others, declared that Kavanaugh must be removed from office, citing the allegation.\\n\\nThe Times\\' update also stated for the first time that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed, and has made no other comment about the episode.\\n\\nThe only firsthand account concerning the supposed attack in the original piece, which was published on Saturday, came from a Clinton-connected lawyer who claimed to have witnessed it. The lawyer, Max Stier, did not actually provide his account directly; the Times acknowledged that \"two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier\" had relayed his supposed version of events.\\n\\nThe Times did not mention Stier\\'s work as a Clinton defense attorney, or Stier\\'s legal battles with Kavanaugh during the Whitewater investigation, and simply called him a \"respected thought leader.\"\\n\\nThe Times went on to note in the article that it had \"corroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier,\" but the article apparently meant only that the Times had corroborated that Stier made his claim to the FBI. No firsthand corroboration of the alleged episode was apparently obtained.\\n\\nThe Times\\' revision stated: \"Editors\\' Note: An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book\\'s account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.\"\\n\\nThe Times\\' update came only after The Federalist\\'s Mollie Hemingway, who reviewed an advance copy of the book, first flagged the article\\'s omission on Twitter — prompting other commentators to press the issue.\\n\\nThe Times did not immediately respond to an email from Fox News seeking comment.

       "  'text': 'President Trump said Monday it’s “looking like” Iran was responsible for weekend attacks on Saudi Arabia’s oil supply, and talked up the United States’ military might -- but said he wanted to “avoid” war.\\n\\n“Well, it’s looking that way,” the president told reporters at the White House when asked if Iran was responsible. “We’ll let you know definitively.” He added: “That’s being checked out right now.”\\n\\nIran has denied involvement in the attacks, which came as tensions rise over Tehran\\'s unraveling nuclear deal with world powers.\\n\\nSAUDI ARABIA OIL FACILITY ATTACK LAUNCHED FROM IRANIAN SOIL, US OFFICIALS SAY\\n\\nThe president said the U.S. would not look at retaliatory options until he had “definitive proof” Iran was responsible.\\n\\nDuring a meeting with Bahrain’s Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, Trump talked up the United States’ weapons systems, including fighter jets and missiles. He said the U.S. “is more prepared” for a conflict than any country in history.\\n\\n“With all that being said, we’d certainly like to avoid it,” he said of a conflict.\\n\\nHe added: “I don’t want war with anybody.”\\n\\nDAMAGE FROM IRAN-LINKED DRONE ATTACK ON SAUDI OIL FACILITY CAPTURED IN SATELLITE IMAGES\\n\\nYemen\\'s Iran-backed Houthi rebels said they launched drone attacks on the world\\'s largest oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia and a major oil field Saturday, sparking huge fires and halting about half of the supplies from the world\\'s largest exporter of oil.\\n\\nThe attacks marked the latest of many drone assaults on the kingdom’s oil infrastructure in recent weeks, but easily the most damaging. They raised concerns about the global oil supply and could further escalate tensions across the Persian Gulf amid a growing crisis between the U.S. and Iran over the troubled nuclear deal.\\n\\nThe fires led to the interruption of an estimated 5.7 million barrels in crude supplies, as Saudi officials said part of that would be offset with stockpiles. Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil giant, planned to provide updated information in the coming days.\\n\\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper attended an emergency National Security Council meeting on Sunday at the White House along with Vice President Pence, where military options were discussed, officials told Fox News.\\n\\nOn Monday afternoon, Esper said on Twitter he returned to the Pentagon from a meeting at the White House where Department of Defense leadership discussed the situation. The Defense Secretary said he spoke with the Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad bin Salman, and Iraqi Minister of Defense al-Shammary about the recent attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities.\\n\\n\"The United States military, with our interagency team, is working with our partners to address this unprecedented attack and defend the international rules-based order that is being undermined by Iran,\" Esper said.\\n\\nEarlier Monday in Austria, Energy Secretary Rick Perry placed the blame for the attack squarely on Iran.\\n\\n\"I want to reiterate that the United States wholeheartedly condemns Iran\\'s attack on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and we call on other nations to do the same,\" Perry told reporters. “This behavior is unacceptable. It is unacceptable and they must be held responsible.\"\\n\\nFox News\\' Lucas Tomlinson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The New York Times suddenly made a major revision to a supposed bombshell piece late Sunday concerning a resurfaced allegation of sexual assault by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh — hours after virtually all 2020 Democratic presidential candidates had cited the original article as a reason to impeach Kavanaugh.\\n\\nThe update included the significant detail that several friends of the alleged victim, Harmon Joyce, said she did not recall the purported sexual assault in question at all. The Times also stated for the first time that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed, and has made no other comment about the episode.\\n\\nThe only firsthand account concerning the supposed attack in the original piece, which was published on Saturday, came from a Clinton-connected lawyer who claimed to have witnessed it. (The lawyer, Max Stier, did not actually provide his account directly; the Times acknowledged that \"two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier\" had relayed his supposed version of events.)\\n\\nThe Times\\' revision says: \"Editors\\' Note: An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book\\'s account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.\"\\n\\nEven after the revision, the Times\\' story still does not mention a separate revelation in the book that Leland Keyser, the friend of Christine Blasey Ford who was allegedly at the party where Kavanaugh supposedly assaulted her, had specifically rejected Ford\\'s claims. Previously, through her attorney, Keyser had said only that she was \"unable to corroborate it because she has no recollection of the incident in question.”\\n\\n“I don’t have any confidence in the story,” Keyser told the reporters, according to the book. \"Those facts together I don\\'t recollect, and it just didn\\'t make any sense.\"\\n\\nThe Times\\' update came only after The Federalist\\'s Mollie Hemingway, who reviewed an advance copy of the book, first flagged the article\\'s omission on Twitter — prompting other commentators to press the issue.\\n\\nThe Times did not immediately respond to an email from Fox News seeking comment.\\n\\nThe paper\\'s editors\\' note, meanwhile, did little to stem a torrent of criticism late Sunday.\\n\\n\"Should I be surprised at this point that the NYT would make such an unforgivable oversight?\" — Mark Hemingway\\n\\n\"Should I be surprised at this point that the NYT would make such an unforgivable oversight?\" asked RealClearInvestigations\\' Mark Hemingway.\\n\\nWrote the Washington Examiner\\'s Jerry Dunleavy: \"Crazy how the \\'one element\\' that wasn’t included in the original article was the part where the alleged victim’s friends said she doesn’t remember it happening.\"\\n\\n\"It’s important to point out that this correction almost certainly would have never occurred if conservative media folks like @MZHemingway and others hadn’t obtained the copy of the actual book itself the same day the excerpt/article was released,\" author James Hasson said.\\n\\nThroughout the day on Sunday, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Beto O\\'Rourke, Cory Booker and Julian Castro, among others, declared that Kavanaugh \"must be impeached,\" citing the allegation.\\n\\nThe revitalized, longshot push to get Kavanaugh removed from the high court came as Democrats\\' apparent effort to impeach President Trump has largely stalled. Trump, for his part, suggested Sunday that Kavanaugh should sue for defamation.\\n\\nThe Times piece by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, adapted from their forthcoming book, asserted that a Kavanaugh classmate, Clinton-linked nonprofit CEO Max Stier, \"saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\"\\n\\nThe Times did not mention Stier\\'s work as a Clinton defense attorney, or Stier\\'s legal battles with Kavanaugh during the Whitewater investigation, and simply called him a \"respected thought leader.\"\\n\\nAccording to the Times, Stier \"notified senators and the FBI about this account\" last year during the Kavanaugh hearings, \"but the FBI did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly.\"\\n\\nHowever, the Times\\' article also conspicuously did not mention that Pogrebin and Kelly\\'s book found that the female student in question had denied any knowledge of the alleged episode.\\n\\n\"The book notes, quietly, that the woman Max Stier named as having been supposedly victimized by Kavanaugh and friends denies any memory of the alleged event,\" observed Mollie Hemingway. \"Seems, I don’t know, significant.\"\\n\\n\\'PART OF WHAT MOTIVATED\\' CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD WAS TO PUT POLITICAL \\'ASTERISK\\' ON KAVANAUGH, LAWYER ADMITS\\n\\nThe book reads: \"[Tracy] Harmon, whose surname is now Harmon Joyce, has also refused to discuss the incident, though several of her friends said she does not recall it.\"\\n\\n\"Omitting these facts from the @nytimes story is one of worst cases of journalistic malpractice that I can recall,\" wrote the National Review\\'s Washington correspondent, John McCormack, on Twitter.\\n\\nMcCormack wrote separately: \"If Kavanaugh’s \\'friends pushed his penis,\\' then isn’t it an allegation of wrongdoing against Kavanaugh’s \\'friends,\\' not Kavanaugh himself? Surely even a modern liberal Yalie who’s been to one of those weird non-sexual \\'naked parties\\' would recognize both the female student and Kavanaugh are both alleged victims in this alleged incident, barring an additional allegation that a college-aged Kavanaugh asked his \\'friends\\' to \\'push his penis.\\'\"\\n\\nNEW YORK TIMES DELETES TWEET CALLING UNPROVOKED PENIS THRUSTING \\'HARMLESS FUN\\'\\n\\nThe Times went on to note in the article that it had \"corroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier,\" but the article apparently meant only that the Times had corroborated that Stier made his claim to the FBI. No first-hand corroboration of the alleged episode was apparently obtained.\\n\\nNevertheless, Democrats announced a new effort to topple Kavanaugh. Hawaii Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono -- who infamously said last year that Kavanaugh did not deserve a fair hearing because he might be pro-life -- said the Senate Judiciary Committee should begin an impeachment inquiry to determine whether Kavanaugh lied to Congress.\\n\\nImpeaching Kavanaugh would require a majority vote in the Democratic-controlled House, and a highly unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-majority Senate would then be needed to remove him from the bench. No Supreme Court justice or president has ever been convicted by the Senate, although eight lower-level federal judges have been.\\n\\nThe long odds didn\\'t stop 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls from joining in on the effort.\\n\\n\"I sat through those hearings,\" Harris wrote on Twitter. \"Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people. He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice. He must be impeached.\"\\n\\nDuring the hearings, Harris strongly implied that she knew Kavanaugh had improperly discussed Special Counsel Robert Mueller\\'s then-ongoing probe with a Trump-connected lawyer.\\n\\nHarris provided no evidence for the bombshell insinuation, which went viral on social media and sent the hearing room into stunned silence, even as she directly accused Kavanaugh of lying under oath.\\n\\nCastro and Warren echoed that sentiment and said Kavanaugh had committed perjury.\\n\\nFLASHBACK: GRAHAM SAYS DEMS\\' KAVANAUGH SMEARS HAVE UNITED REPUBLICANS\\n\\nFLASHBACK: FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS KAVANAUGH FIGHT HAS REVITALIZED GOP BASE, INCREASED REPUBLICAN INTEREST IN ELECTION\\n\\n\"It’s more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath,\" Castro wrote. \"He should be impeached. And Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter.\"\\n\\nWarren wrote: \"Last year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him. Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached.\"\\n\\nO\\'Rourke claimed to \"know\" that Kavanaugh had lied under oath, and falsely said that the new accuser was not known to Senate Democrats or the FBI last year.\\n\\n\"Yesterday, we learned of another accusation against Brett Kavanaugh—one we didn\\'t find out about before he was confirmed because the Senate forced the F.B.I. to rush its investigation to save his nomination,\" O\\'Rourke said. \"We know he lied under oath. He should be impeached.\"\\n\\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., tweeted in part, \"This new allegation and additional corroborating evidence adds to a long list of reasons why Brett Kavanaugh should not be a Supreme Court justice. I stand with survivors and countless other Americans in calling for impeachment proceedings to begin.\"\\n\\nAmy Klobuchar stopped short of calling for impeachment, and instead posted a picture of Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford with the words, \"Let us never forget what courage looks like.\"\\n\\nDEM SENATOR CITES KAVANAUGH\\'S ALLEGED PRO-LIFE LEANINGS AS REASON TO DENY HIM A FAIR HEARING\\n\\nBernie Sanders, meanwhile, said he backed getting rid of Kavanaugh by any legal means available: \"The revelations today confirm what we already knew: During his hearing, Kavanaugh faced credible accusations and likely lied to Congress. I support any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold him accountable.\"\\n\\nAs the calls mounted, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., shot back Sunday afternoon on Twitter -- and made clear that Kavanaugh wasn\\'t going anywhere.\\n\\n\"The far left’s willingness to seize on completely uncorroborated and unsubstantiated allegations during last year’s confirmation process was a dark and embarrassing chapter for the Senate,\" McConnell wrote.\\n\\nHe added: \"Fortunately a majority of Senators and the American people rallied behind timeless principles such as due process and the presumption of innocence. I look forward to many years of service to come from Justice Kavanaugh.\"\\n\\nThe Times\\' piece also stated that well before Kavanaugh became a federal judge, \"at least seven people\" had heard about how he allegedly exposed himself to Deborah Ramirez at a party.\\n\\nRamirez had called classmates at Yale seeking corroboration for her story, and even told some of her classmates that she could not remember the culprit in the alleged episode -- before changing her mind and publicly blaming Kavanaugh \"after six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney,\" the New Yorker reported last year in a widely derided piece.\\n\\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee, then led by Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, wrote in an executive summary of its investigation that it contacted Ramirez’s counsel \"seven times seeking evidence to support claims made in the New Yorker,\" but that \"Ms. Ramirez produced nothing in response and refused a Committee request for an interview.\"\\n\\nLate Sunday, Grassley\\'s office called out the Times for omitting key details in the story published this weekend.\\n\\n\"@NYTimes did not contact Sen. Grassley’s office for this story. If they had, we would\\'ve reminded them of a few key public facts they omitted,\" Grassley\\'s team wrote. \"Despite 7 attempts by staff, Ms. Ramirez\\' lawyers declined to provide documentary evidence referenced in the article/witness accounts to support the claims. They also declined invitations for Ms. Ramirez to speak with committee investigators or to provide a written statement.\"\\n\\nAdditionally, the FBI separately reached out to nearly a dozen individuals to corroborate the allegations by Ford and Ramirez, and ultimately spoke to ten individuals and two eyewitnesses, but apparently found no corroboration.\\n\\nThe agency\\'s investigation began after then-Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., called for a one-week delay in Kavanaugh\\'s confirmation hearings so an independent agency could look into the claims against him. Flake said the FBI\\'s probe needed to be limited in length to avoid derailing the proceedings with endless claims and probes going back to Kavanaugh\\'s high school years.\\n\\nKavanaugh, predicted by Democrats during his confirmation process to be a hardline conservative, often sided with liberal justices during the Supreme Court\\'s last term.\\n\\nThe president, meanwhile, accused the media of trying to influence Kavanaugh. He also went on to say that Kavanaugh should go on the offensive and take on the media for false statements.\\n\\n\"Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue. The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can’t let that happen!\" he tweeted.\\n\\nGrassley sent several criminal referrals to the Justice Department related to alleged lies submitted to Senate investigators during Kavanaugh\\'s confirmation process -- which could be what the president meant when he wrote Sunday that the DOJ \"should come to [Kavanuagh\\'s] rescue.\"\\n\\nOne of those referrals was for now-disgraced attorney Michael Avenatti and one of his clients, Julie Swetnick, regarding a potential \"conspiracy\" to provide false statements to Congress and obstruct its investigation. Swetnick\\'s credibility took a hit as she changed her story about Kavanaugh\\'s purported gang-rape trains, and her ex-boyfriend went public to say she was known for \"exaggerating everything.\"\\n\\nSwetnick and Ramirez were just two of several women who had accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct during his confirmation process. Christine Blasey Ford notably testified that Kavanaugh attempted to sexually assault her at a party when they were teens, and dubiously asserted that the memory was \"indelible\" in her \"hippocampus\" -- although no witnesses could corroborate her ever-changing story -- even her close lifelong friend, Leland Keyser, who Ford said had attended the party.\\n\\nKeyser, according to the Times reporters\\' new book, did not believe Ford\\'s story -- and refused to change her mind, despite pressure from progressive activists and Ford\\'s friends.\\n\\n\"It just didn\\'t make any sense,\" Keyser said, referring to Ford\\'s explanation of how she was assaulted at a party that Keyser attended, but could not recall how she got home.\\n\\nFord\\'s attorney, Debra Katz, was quoted in a new book as saying that Ford was motivated to come forward in part by a desire to tag Kavanaugh\\'s reputation with an \"asterisk\" before he could start ruling on abortion-related cases.\\n\\n\"In the aftermath of these hearings, I believe that Christine’s testimony brought about more good than the harm misogynist Republicans caused by allowing Kavanaugh on the court,\" Katz said. \"He will always have an asterisk next to his name. When he takes a scalpel to Roe v. Wade, we will know who he is, we know his character, and we know what motivates him, and that is important.\\n\\n\"It is important that we know, and that is part of what motivated Christine.\"\\n\\nThe Federalist reported last week that Ford\\'s father privately supported Kavanaugh\\'s confirmation, and approached Ed Kavanaugh on a golf course to make his support clear.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nSome claims that surfaced during Kavanaugh\\'s confirmation fell apart within days. For example, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., received a call from an anonymous constituent who claimed that in 1985, two \"heavily inebriated men\" referred to as \"Brett and Mark\" had sexually assaulted a friend of hers on a boat.\\n\\nThe Twitter account belonging to the accuser apparently advocated for a military coup against the Trump administration. The constituent recanted the sexual assault claim on the social media site days later.\\n\\nFox News\\' Andrew Craft in Plano, Texas, Chad Pergram, and Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report.',\n",

       "  'text': 'A newly surfaced video clip from 2017 shows Joe Biden recounting a bizarre alleged incident in which he deftly avoided a razor-and-chain fight with a gang leader named Corn Pop, when Biden was serving as the only white lifeguard at a predominately black Delaware pool in the summer of 1962.\\n\\nBiden\\'s explanation of how he made Corn Pop stand down was making the rounds on social media as the former vice president was seeking to burnish his credentials with black voters. His extraordinary lifeguarding tale was immediately questioned by commentators with sway in the black community -- however, some corroborating evidence emerged later in the day Sunday indicating some version of that tale really did happen.\\n\\nThe former vice president has long claimed that he had applied to be a lifeguard at the pool to better understand black America, and wrote in his 2007 memoir that Corn Pop often tormented him at the pool. For example, Biden said Corn Pop -- the purported leader of a gang called \"the Romans\" -- would insult Biden\\'s mother to distract him so that people could sneak into the pool.\\n\\n\"I learned a lot. And I learned that it makes a difference,\" Biden said in the 2017 video clip, which documented the ceremony in which the Brown-Burton-Winchester Park was renamed the Joseph R. Biden Jr. Aquatic Center.\\n\\nThe clip was recorded and aired originally by WITN22 in Wilmington.\\n\\n\"This was the diving board area, and I was one of the guards, and they weren\\'t allowed to -- it was a 3-meter board. And if you fell off sideways, you landed on the damn, er, darn cement over there,\" Biden said.\\n\\nSome members of the crowd laughed, apparently at Biden correcting his language, as a small gathering of black children surrounding Biden looked ahead, seemingly disinterested.\\n\\n\"And Corn Pop was a bad dude. And he ran a bunch of bad boys. And back in those days -- to show how things have changed -- one of the things you had to use, if you used Pomade in your hair, you had to wear a baby cap. And so he was up on the board and wouldn\\'t listen to me. I said, \\'Hey, Esther, you! Off the board, or I\\'ll come up and drag you off.\\' Well, he came off, and he said, \\'I\\'ll meet you outside.\\'\"\\n\\nBiden\\'s comments were a reference to competitive swimmer-turned actress Esther Williams, who died in 2013.\\n\\n\"My car was mostly, these were all public housing behind us,\" Biden continued. \"My car - there was a gate on here. I parked my car outside the gate. And he said, \\'I\\'ll be waiting for you. He was waiting for me with three guys with straight razors. Not a joke. There was a guy named Bill Wright the only white guy and he did all the pools. He was a mechanic. And I said, \\'What am I gonna do?\\' And he said. \\'Come down here in the basement, where all the mechanics- - where all the pool builder is.\\' You know the chain, there used to be a chain that went across the deep end. And he cut off a six-foot length of chain, and folded it up and he said, \\'You walk out with that chain, and you walk to the car and say, \\'you may cut me man, but I\\'m gonna wrap this chain around your head.\\'\"\\n\\nBIDEN CLAIMS DETAILS \\'IRRELEVANT\\' AFTER GETTING CAUGHT TELLING FALSE WAR STORY\\n\\nBiden continued: \"I said, \\'You\\'re kidding me.\\'\" He said, \\'No if you don\\'t, don\\'t come back.\\' And he was right. So I walked out with the chain. And I walked up to my car. And in those days, you remember the straight razors, you had to bang \\'em on the curb, gettin\\' em rusty, puttin\\' em in the rain barrel, gettin\\' em rusty? And I looked at him, but I was smart, then. I said, \\'First of all,\\' I said, \\'when I tell you to get off the board, you get off the board, and I\\'ll kick you out again, but I shouldn\\'t have called you Esther Williams, and I apologize for that. I apologize.\\' But I didn\\'t know that apology was gonna work.\"\\n\\n\"Corn Pop was a bad dude.\" — Joe Biden\\n\\n\"He said, \\'you apologize to me?\\'\" Biden went on. \"I said, \\'I apologize but not for throwing you out, but I apologize for what I said.\\' He said, \\'OK,\\' closed that straight razor, and my heart began to beat again.\"\\n\\nReaction to the clip was a mixture of befuddlement and skepticism.\\n\\n\"What is going on? I\\'m really confused and I feel like I\\'m losing my mind,\" journalist Yashar Ali wrote.\\n\\nHowever, former Delaware NAACP President Richard Smith corroborated Biden\\'s account, saying the former vice president “stood his ground\" despite Corn Pop\\'s aggression.\\n\\nAnd, contemporaneous newspaper reports uncovered by CNN reporter Daniel Dale revealed that an individual nicknamed \"Corn Pop\" did live in Wilmington, and died in 2016 at the age of 73. A former Wilmington mayor confirmed that the individual was the same person to whom Biden was referring.\\n\\nAdditionally, a gang called \"the Romans\" did exist, Dale found.\\n\\nSpeaking after Biden at the 2017 dedication, Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del., later referred to the gang leader as \"Pop Corn,\" and told attendees that Biden\\'s story was \"special\" because it \"showed the kind of man that Joe Biden is.\"\\n\\n\"He wasn\\'t afraid to be the only white lifeguard here,\" Rochester said. \"He never shied away. And so, to me, this pool is really representative of this man. ... This pool acts as an inspiration to us. He was basically saying, \\'stay woke,\\' before millenials were saying \\'stay woke.\\' And, that\\'s the situation we\\'re in right now. And so, this pool is a representation of you. We love you. Thank you so much for all of your service.\"\\n\\nBut, others had their doubts.\\n\\n\"They told Biden that Corn Pop carried a straight razor and was gonna be waiting for him when he got off work,\" wrote The Root\\'s Michael Harriott. \"Now you and I both know that, if this was true, Biden would\\'ve just called the cops to walk him to the car.\"\\n\\nHarriott added: \"Anyway, Biden says, instead he wrapped a 6-foot metal chain around his arm and wrapped that in a towel. Because everyone knows there are ample black chains just laying around the \\'African-American community\\' but no police officers.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s \"already been demonstrably proven Biden will make stuff up,\" Harriott noted.\\n\\nBiden, indeed, earnestly has told inaccurate stories in the past. A headline in The Washington Post last month, for example, read simply: \"As he campaigns for president, Joe Biden tells a moving but false war story.\"\\n\\nThat incident involved an inaccurate claim by Biden that he had brushed aside security concerns to travel to Afghanistan, on a general\\'s request, to pin a Silver Star on an American soldier who rappelled into a ravine to retrieve a dead comrade. Biden gave his \"word as a Biden\" that he was telling \"God\\'s truth\" as he explained that the soldier resisted Biden\\'s efforts to pin the Silver Star on him.\\n\\n\"Except almost every detail in the story appears to be incorrect,\" the Post found. \"Based on interviews with more than a dozen U.S. troops, their commanders and Biden campaign officials, it appears as though the former vice president has jumbled elements of at least three actual events into one story of bravery, compassion and regret that never happened.\"\\n\\nBiden later dismissed concerns about his apparent fabrications as irrelevant.\\n\\n“That has nothing to do with judgment of whether or not you send troops to war, the judgment of whether you bring someone home, the judgment of whether you decide on a health care policy,\" Biden said in comments aired last month by the NPR Politics Podcast and Iowa Public Radio. “The details are irrelevant in terms of decision-making.”\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nCommentators also have doubted many of Biden\\'s other claims. For instance, The Washington Free Beacon\\'s Alex Griswold reacted with skepticism to a Biden story about how his father, in the 1950s, had reacted to the site of two men kissing by telling his son: \"Joey, they love each other, it\\'s simple.\"\\n\\n\"Oh sure, I absolutely believe that Joe Biden saw two men kissing publicly in the 1950s, and that his Irish-Catholic father reacted by approving of it,\" Griswold wrote.',\n",

Biden Jr. The party endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont during the last presidential cycle, at which time he described Working Families as ‘the closest thing’ to ‘my vision of democratic socialism.’ The group’s endorsement of Ms. Warren on Monday, one of the few by a prominent progressive organization this early in the primary, could turn heads among left-leaning Democrats desperate to defeat Mr. Biden, the more moderate front-runner, in a primary election where their party’s ideological future is at stake.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBernie shakes up New Hampshire staff - Fox News: “Facing discontent and unheeded warnings from longtime supporters that he could lose the New Hampshire primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont on Sunday replaced the director of his presidential campaign operations in the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House. The campaign broke the news on Sunday to more than 40 members of Sanders’ steering committee. The campaign announced that Joe Caiazzo was being replaced as state director. Shannon Jackson, who made the announcement, will replace him. Jackson ran Sanders’ 2018 Senate re-election campaign and was a senior adviser on the independent senator’s 2016 White House bid as well as the current campaign. … The move comes as some Sanders supporters in New Hampshire are looking over their shoulders at Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts - the other progressive standard bearer in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential candidates.”\\n\\n\\n\\nTeam Biden warns: Warren can’t connect with blue collar voters - Politico: “As Elizabeth Warren climbs in the polls, Joe Biden’s Massachusetts allies are warning that her election history suggests she runs weakest among the types of voters Democrats need to win over to capture the White House. While Warren won reelection easily in 2018, Biden’s backers point to her performance among independent and blue-collar voters as evidence she’ll fail to appeal to similar voters in the Rust Belt – just as Hillary Clinton did in 2016. ‘The grave concern of many of us Democrats in Massachusetts is that in many of the counties where Sen. Warren underperforms, they are demographically and culturally similar to voters in key swing states,’ said state Rep. John Rogers, who backs Biden. … Warren’s critics have long assailed the former Harvard Law School professor for being too far liberal and too out-of-touch with blue-collar voters to beat Donald Trump, despite an economic message that speaks directly to many of their concerns.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBeto comes after Buttigieg over his conciliatory tone on guns - Fox News: “Beto O’Rourke launched an expletive-fueled defense of his call Sunday to ban assault-style weapons and impose mandatory buybacks of AR-15s and AK-47s while also pushing back at critics – including fellow 2020 Democrat Pete Buttigieg. During last Thursday’s presidential debate, the former Texas congressman said, ‘Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47…’ Buttigieg [said] the clip … ‘will be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying Democrats are coming for your guns.’ … O’Rourke pushed back in a tweet: …. ‘When candidates say, ‘At least Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell are pretending to be interested,' sh--, that is not enough. Neither is poll-testing your message. Gun violence is a life or death issue—and we have to represent the bold ideas of people all over the country.’”\\n\\n\\n\\nOld school South Carolina politics get a boost - NYT: [Today] organizers of the 2019 Galivants Ferry Stump will add new twists to what has become a 143-year tradition. For the first time, the stump meeting will host presidential candidates — and it will do so in the fall of an odd-numbered year. … But with interest in the Democratic primary so high in South Carolina, an early voting state, and no stump event planned until long after the state’s primary voters go to the polls, organizers said they had felt compelled to break from tradition and invite presidential contenders to Galivants Ferry in the fall. As of late Sunday, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York; Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.; and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota were scheduled to attend.\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE RULEBOOK: PRODUCTIVE, BUT NOT IN A GOOD WAY\\n\\n“The public debt of the Union would be a further cause of collision between the separate States or confederacies. The apportionment, in the first instance, and the progressive extinguishment afterward, would be alike productive of ill-humor and animosity.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 7\\n\\n\\n\\nTIME OUT: SWEATER WEATHER\\n\\nThe Atlantic: “In his 2005 memoir, Yvon Chouinard, the founder of Patagonia, claimed that his outdoor-clothing company, founded in 1973, was the first to bring the concept to the outdoors community. But the idea goes back further than that. Almost every American’s understanding of layering comes from the mid-century U.S. military. In 1943, the Quartermaster Corps—the branch of the U.S. Army charged with procuring uniforms, among many other essential logistics of war—introduced an experimental new uniform kit, which it named the M-43. The ensemble included a woolen undershirt, a long-sleeved, flannel shirt, and a sweater. … The military shaped Americans’ sense of style in other ways, too. After demobilization, the historian Paul Fussell explains, veterans who had gotten used to ‘loose, highly informal’ uniforms were primed to keep shifting men’s fashion toward casual wear. Out were the ‘trim fit and exaggerated shoulders’ of the prewar period. Looking prepared to get one’s hands dirty, as a soldier might in an M-43 jacket, became more important than a tailored appearance.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFlag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.\\n\\n\\n\\nSCOREBOARD\\n\\nDEMOCRATIC 2020 POWER RANKING\\n\\nBiden: 29 points\\n\\nWarren: 18.6 points\\n\\nSanders: 15 points\\n\\nHarris: 6.8 points\\n\\nButtigieg: 5.2 points\\n\\n[Averages include: CNN, ABC News/WaPo, IBD, Quinnipiac University and USA Today/Suffolk University.]\\n\\n\\n\\nTRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE\\n\\nAverage approval: 40 percent\\n\\nAverage disapproval: 54.8 percent\\n\\nNet Score: -14.8 percent\\n\\nChange from one week ago: no change in points\\n\\n[Average includes: NPR/PBS/Marist: 41% approve - 54% disapprove; CNN: 42% approve - 54% disapprove; ABC News/WaPo: 40% approve - 55% disapprove; IBD: 39% approve - 55% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 38% approve - 56% disapprove.]\\n\\n\\n\\nWANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\\n\\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

The major revision to the Times' reporting came several hours after various politicians, including virtually all major 2020 Democratic candidates for president, cited the Times' reporting as a reason to impeach Kavanaugh. … Top 2020 Democratic contenders Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Beto O'Rourke, Cory Booker and Julian Castro announced on Sunday that Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh ‘must be impeached,’ after an uncorroborated and disputed allegation of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh resurfaced in a weekend New York Times piece. The revitalized, longshot push to get Kavanaugh removed from the high court comes as Democrats' apparent effort to impeach President Trump has largely stalled. Trump, for his part, suggested Sunday that Kavanaugh should sue for defamation.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPaper botched rollout - NYT: “James Dao, deputy editorial page editor for The Times, said in a statement that the essay was ‘a well-reported and newsworthy account that sheds new light on a matter that provoked significant national debate.’ The Times was roundly criticized for a tweet — which was later deleted — made on its Opinion account on Saturday about the essay that read: ‘Having a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun. But when Brett Kavanaugh did it to her, Deborah Ramirez says, it confirmed that she didn’t belong at Yale in the first place.’ Mr. Dao said the tweet ‘was clearly offensive and never should have gone out and we sincerely apologize.’”\\n\\n\\n\\nTRUMP REACHES FOR NEW MEXICO\\n\\nAxios: “At a Trump rally back in February in El Paso, Texas, the campaign saw an unexpected pattern in the attendee data – a large crowd of New Mexicans crossed the state line to be there. ‘That was our first glimpse into the idea that there might be something happening,’ the Trump campaign's Tim Murtaugh told Axios…. Since then, New Mexico has become an unlikely target for the 2020 Trump campaign. It's the state with the highest percentage of Hispanics and Latinos (about 1 in 2 residents), and it's gone with Democrats in 6 of the last 7 general elections. … Demographers and pollsters tell Axios it's highly unlikely Trump can win New Mexico's 5 electoral votes. The state Latino population is overwhelmingly Democratic. Major New Mexico cities are booming and moving left politically, while Republican strongholds are losing their share of the population. Trump lost New Mexico in 2016, and his net approval rating has plummeted from +17 when he first took office to -13 as of July.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHouse GOPers chafe at Trump-allied consultants - Politico: “House Republicans sparred behind closed doors with Trump-aligned political operatives at a GOP retreat over the new online fundraising platform backed by party leaders and the White House. The fight Thursday over WinRed's data and competitiveness highlights long simmering tensions between GOP lawmakers and operatives allied with the president, and underscores the growing frustrations in the party as they try to hash out a strategy to win back the House next year. … Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) specifically raised concerns about data sharing, while other lawmakers were confused with how the operation works and pressed operatives for more information about the fundraising tool, according to aides and lawmakers who were present. Stefanik, who formerly led recruitment efforts for the GOP’s campaign arm, pressed WinRed president Gerrit Lansing about whether lawmakers who use the apparatus would have to share their data with other people and questioned how it could be protected, several sources said.”\\n\\n\\n\\nDEM LEADERS DRAW LINE ON GUN LEGISLATION\\n\\nPolitico: “Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer warned President Donald Trump on Sunday that any firearm legislation that falls short of universal background checks for gun sales ‘will not get the job done,’ complicating delicate negotiations between the president and a group of senators. Trump has been discussing potential legislation with senators in both parties that would expand background checks but would not go as far as House-passed legislation that would apply them to all gun sales with limited exceptions. Trump issued a veto threat on the House’s background-checks bill earlier this year, and few Republicans in Congress support it. But in a conversation with Trump on Sunday morning, the House speaker and Senate minority leader indicated to Trump that they were taking a much harder line than rank-and-file senators involved in the talks.”\\n\\n\\n\\nRocky start for shutdown talks - The Hill: “Senate government funding talks are off to a rough start with 10 working days to go until the shutdown deadline. The impasse is throwing into question if senators will be able to get any of the fiscal year 2020 bills through the chamber this month, a setback for Republicans who wanted to clear a major package before October. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said he still wants to bring bills to the Senate floor for a vote but warned that lawmakers need to ‘negotiate the terrain.’ ‘We’ve been down that road before,’ he said, asked how the funding talks get unstuck. ‘There’s got to be a resolution to it—it could be sooner. It could be later.’ The partisan breakdown has left lawmakers visibly flummoxed about how to resolve the impasse. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) described the negotiations as ‘pretty fragile.’”\\n\\n\\n\\nLewandowski may use testimony as Senate springboard - Axios: “Watch for Trump's former campaign manager at the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday – and not just because of the prospect of a fiery exchange with Chairman Jerry Nadler. … If Corey Lewandowski goes forward with a run for the Senate in his home state of New Hampshire – which he's seriously considering, a spokesperson says – he'd be the first in Trump's inner circle to test those coattails. … ‘Corey will use [the hearing] as part of the campaign. He will be confrontational to the Democrats. He will be totally loyal to Trump. And he will be playing to the right wing of the party who need to unite behind him in a primary,’ Thomas Rath, former attorney general of New Hampshire and adviser to several GOP presidential candidates, tells Axios. … The Judiciary Committee plans to press for more information about possible obstruction of justice by Trump outlined in Robert Mueller’s report, including his asking Lewandowski to press then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to end the Russia investigation.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\\n\\nDays after resigning as National Security Advisor John Bolton takes old job back as head of two political action committees – USA Today\\n\\n\\n\\nPergram: ‘US political discourse needs more ‘flying flamingos’ – Fox News\\n\\n\\n\\nAUDIBLE: WEIRD FLEX…\\n\\n“What health concerns man, you wanna wrestle?” – Former Vice President Joe Biden said after a reporter asked when he is going to release his medical records to address concerns about his health Friday afternoon in Houston following a campaign event.\\n\\n\\n\\nFROM THE BLEACHERS\\n\\n“Thank you for making it safe to get into the political waters again. After years as a news junkie with my own election night spreadsheet, the last election and personal life trials sent me into a cave.

I don’t belong to a political party because, let’s face it, people are people, and I think we often lose our ability to think clearly because we just want our team to win. I know that with you, I’ll get a straight, yet quirky, answer and not spin. You nailed it in ITYW this week talking about the American people being tired of getting yelled at. We are tired. We’re worn down and oftentimes, dejected by the choices in front of us and the hatred being spewed from all directions.

Caught on camera by a couple of nearby photographers, who were taking pictures of the lone grazing grizzly on Highway 93 and called [the Royal Canadian Mounted Police] after the incident, Mitsuing was later located in Radium, B.C. by RCMP and a Park Warden and charged under the National Parks Act, for disturbing wildlife in a national park.

       "  'text': 'The House Judiciary Committee\\'s first hearing as part of its Trump impeachment investigation descended into chaos Tuesday as Democrats clashed with a combative Corey Lewandowski, trading insults and accusations with the former Trump campaign manager, who refused to answer many of their questions.\\n\\nAfter five hours of testimony before lawmakers, the top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Jerry Nadler, told Lewandowski his “behavior in this hearing room has been completely unacceptable,” and said holding him \"in contempt\" is \"certainly under consideration.\"\\n\\nLewandowski immediately frustrated Nadler, the committee\\'s chairman, during the Democrat\\'s first question earlier in the day – when the witness, in an apparent effort to stall for time, repeatedly asked Nadler to point to the specific section in the Robert Mueller report related to his question. Lewandowski was following White House orders not to discuss confidential conversations with the president beyond what was already public in the former special counsel\\'s report.\\n\\nDOJ USES DEMOCRATS’ IMPEACHMENT CONFUSION AGAINST THEM IN COURT\\n\\nAsked by Nadler if he met alone with President Donald Trump in June 2017, Lewandowski said, “Could you read the exact language of the report? I don’t have it available to me.”\\n\\n“I don’t think I need to do that,” Nadler shot back. “I have limited time.”\\n\\nAsked the question again, Lewandowski told Nadler he needed him to “refresh” his memory of what was in the report. He demanded that Democrats provide him a copy of the report, sending Democratic staff scrambling to find one.\\n\\n\"He\\'s filibustering,\" a frustrated Nadler said.\\n\\nAmid the back-and-forth, the top Republican on the committee, Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, moved to adjourn the hearing, forcing a failed voice vote that caused further delay, before questioning resumed from other lawmakers.\\n\\nLewandowski later declined to play along with certain questions. New York Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries asked Lewandowski if he was Trump’s “hitman, the bag man, the lookout, or all of the above?\"\\n\\n\"I think I\\'m the good looking man, actually,\" Lewandowski replied.\\n\\nLewandowski is considering a run for the Senate in New Hampshire in 2020. In a reminder of the political backdrop, during a recess, the witness tweeted out a link to a website promoting his possible candidacy. And Democrats referenced his ambitions.\\n\\n\"You are not on the campaign trail yet,\" Jeffries said. \"This is the House Judiciary Committee. Act like you know the difference.\"\\n\\nThere were fireworks from the beginning. Nadler opened by saying the hearing is part of efforts to “determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment with respect to President Trump.” He railed against the White House’s efforts to block the testimony of two other former Trump aides — Rick Dearborn and Rob Porter — who did not show up on orders from the administration.\\n\\n“This is a cover-up, plain and simple,” Nadler said of the White House’s efforts to block testimony from Dearborn and Porter.\\n\\nAt another point, Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee told Lewandowski, “You are obviously here to block any reasonable inquiry into the truth or not of this administration.\"\\n\\nLewandowski fired back that he was unable to give her a response because it wasn’t a question but a “rant.”\\n\\nDuring his questioning, Georgia Rep. Hank Johnson said, “Mr. Lewandowski, you are like a fish being cleaned with a spoon — it’s very hard to get an answer out of you.”\\n\\nLewandowski appeared to mock California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell’s unsuccessful bid for the White House earlier this year, calling him “President Swalwell” at one point during questioning. Rhode Island Democratic Rep. David Cicilline suggested that the committee hold Lewandowski in contempt over his refusal to cooperate with Democratic questions.\\n\\nDemocrats repeatedly asked questions about Mueller’s report, which said Trump asked Lewandowski to direct then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to limit Mueller\\'s investigation. The report said Trump said that if Sessions would not meet with Lewandowski, then Lewandowski should tell Sessions he was fired. Lewandowski never delivered the message but asked Dearborn, a former Sessions aide, to do it. Dearborn said he was uncomfortable with the request and declined to deliver it, according to the report.\\n\\nTennessee Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen -- who once brought a bucket of fried chicken to a hearing after Attorney General Bill Barr did not show up for it -- suggested to Lewandowski that he “chickened out.” During another exchange, Lewandowski replied that he did not, and claimed he went on a family vacation.\\n\\nIn his opening statement, Lewandowski railed against the Trump investigations.\\n\\n“It is now clear the investigation was populated by many Trump haters who had their own agenda – to try and take down a duly elected president of the United States,” he said. “As for actual collusion or conspiracy, there was none. What there has been, however, is harassment of this president from the day he won the election.”\\n\\nThe president was apparently watching, and tweeted: \"Such a beautiful Opening Statement by Corey Lewandowski! Thank you Corey!\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, Republicans mocked the hearing, with a fired-up ranking member Collins dismissing it as “re-run season,” saying the committee’s previous hearing with Mueller didn’t “go well.” Collins dismissed the Democrats\\' effort to seek impeachment, saying, “You don’t have the votes.”\\n\\nMueller found that there was not enough evidence to establish a conspiracy between Trump\\'s campaign and Russia, but reached no conclusion on obstruction of justice. Barr later made his own decision on obstruction, saying there was insufficient evidence.\\n\\nAfter lawmakers finished their inquiries Tuesday, Lewandowski was questioned into the early evening by Democratic counsel Barry Berke. Republicans on the committee decried the move of bringing in Berke, who was hired as a consultant and is not on the committee staff.\\n\\n“This move to have private consultants question a witness during an oversight hearing is an egregious violation of the Rules of the House and pretends that the Judiciary Committee’s Article I oversight authority extends to private attorneys when it doesn’t,” Collins said in a statement. “I cannot believe that Judiciary Democrats are outsourcing their pseudo-impeachment inquiry to paid consultants.”\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nThe hearing underscores what has been a central dilemma for House Democrats all year — they have promised to investigate Trump, aggressively, and many of their base supporters want them to move quickly to try to remove him from office. But the White House has blocked their oversight requests at most every turn, declining to provide new documents or allow former aides to testify.\\n\\nThe Republican Senate is certain to rebuff any House efforts to bring charges against the president. And moderate Democrats in their own caucus have expressed nervousness that the impeachment push could crowd out their other accomplishments.\\n\\nStill, the Judiciary panel is moving ahead, approving rules for impeachment hearings last week.\\n\\nFox News\\' Catherine Herridge and The Associated Press contributed to this report.',\n",

Snowden, who famously leaked classified documents about government surveillance, has avoided prosecution by living in Russia.\\n\\nEDWARD SNOWDEN SAYS HE WILL RETURN TO US ON ONE CONDITION\\n\\n“Edward Snowden has violated an obligation he undertook to the United States when he signed agreements as part of his employment by the CIA and as an NSA contractor,” said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division.\\n\\nThe filing alleges that Snowden violated his non-disclosure agreements by failing to submit his manuscript to the agencies for pre-publication review, as is a standard process for former employees and contractors of the agencies.\\n\\nThe DOJ aims to ensure that no funds are transferred to Snowden or at his direction while the court is resolving the United States\\' claims. The immediate consequence could be the freezing of book revenue.\\n\\n“Intelligence information should protect our nation, not provide personal profit,” said G. Zachary Terwilliger, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. “This lawsuit will ensure that Edward Snowden receives no monetary benefits from breaching the trust placed in him.”\\n\\nThis case was filed in the Eastern District of Virginia and is separate from the criminal case against Snowden for allegedly disclosing classified information.\\n\\nSnowden responded to the lawsuit, tweeting, \"The government of the United States has just announced a lawsuit over my memoir, which was just released today worldwide.

       "  'text': 'Andrew Yang insisted to Fox News this week that his “small army of very, very, smart lawyers” assures him his pitch to give 10 random families $1,000 per month -- to spotlight his plan for a universal basic income for all adult Americans -- “is perfectly legal.”\\n\\nBut some leading campaign finance experts are taking issue with the Democratic presidential candidate’s provocative promotion and say it’s likely Yang’s breaking campaign finance laws.\\n\\nTRUMP WEIGHS IN AFTER WRITER\\'S ANDREW YANG TWEET\\n\\nThe problem for the tech entrepreneur, who’s seen his once long-shot bid for the White House gain traction this summer thanks to the buzz generated by his so-called ‘Freedom Dividend,’ is that federal law prohibits campaign contributions from being used for personal purposes. Those uses include such things as paying the mortgage or rent, buying groceries, purchasing clothes or filling up the car with gas -- basically any expense that could be made without a campaign purpose.\\n\\nLarry Noble, a former Federal Election Commission general counsel, tweeted that “a lottery to give money to potential supporters may violate law and is a slippery slope.”\\n\\nThe nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, which works to minimize the influence of big money in politics, tweeted \"Before @AndrewYang starts handing out campaign money, he might want to ask an election law expert to explain 52 USC 30114(b), the section of the Federal Code that bans the conversion of campaign funds to personal use.\"\\n\\nAnd former U.S. attorney Preet Bharara, an anti-corruption crusader, questioned whether Yang “vetted his $1000/month to voters from campaign funds with an actual lawyer.”\\n\\nCampaign finance expert Craig Holman, who serves as Public Citizen’s Capitol Hill lobbyist on ethics, lobbying and campaign finance rules, told Fox News that federal law “defines personal purposes as any expense that [is] irrespective of the campaign. In other words, if it’s an expense that could be made without any campaign purpose, that’s a personal purpose.”\\n\\nHolman said it would likely be a “violation of the federal campaign finance law” if Yang uses campaign funds to pay the 10 families $1,000 per month.\\n\\nYANG PREDICTS HE\\'LL DOUBLE CAMPAIGN CASH HAUL IN THIRD QUARTER\\n\\nBut Yang’s campaign says the payments are considered a campaign expense because they’re being made “to further the goals of the campaign.”\\n\\nIn a bout of showmanship, Yang announced in his opening statement at last week’s third round Democratic presidential debate that “I\\'m going to do something unprecedented tonight.”\\n\\nThe candidate then highlighted that his campaign “will now give a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for an entire year to 10 American families, someone watching this at home right now. If you believe that you can solve your own problems better than any politician, go to yang2020.com and tell us how $1,000 a month will help you do just that.”\\n\\nYang – in front of millions of people watching the debate – emphasized that “when you donate money to a presidential campaign, what happens? The politician spends the money on TV ads and consultants and you hope it works out. It\\'s time to trust ourselves more than our politicians.”\\n\\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\\n\\nYang was the CEO of the test-prep education company Manhattan GMAT. In 2011, he launched Venture for America, a New York City-headquartered organization that trains entrepreneurs. Since declaring his candidacy for president a year and a half ago, the central theme of his campaign is that automation is increasingly displacing the country’s workforce and that a cash payment will be needed for people to afford to live through the automation evolution.\\n\\nThe candidate argues that his ‘Freedom Dividend’ of $12,000 per year to each adult American “would help people improve their health, nutrition, pay off some debts and bills that have been hanging over them, reduce their stress levels.”\\n\\nYang explains that his plan would be paid for by a value-added tax, known as a VAT. He’s estimated a 10 percent VAT would raise some $700-800 billion.\\n\\nTo publicize his universal basic income proposal, Yang’s already paying $1,000 a month to three families, in the early voting caucus and primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire, as well as another in the key battleground state of Florida. But Yang’s been bankrolling those contributions from his own personal funds.\\n\\n“I talked to the FEC and they said as long as it’s my personal funds, and it’s a personal gift with no strings attached, they have no issues,” Yang told Fox News in February, when the first family began receiving their monthly payments.\\n\\nHe added that he was “optimistic” the families receiving his personal cash payments this year “will come out for me, but I have no expectations and certainly no obligations.”\\n\\nHe described the payments as gifts on his campaign finance reports to the FEC.\\n\\nBut using campaign funds to bankroll 10 more families is a whole new ballgame.\\n\\nHowever, there\\'s a twist: The FEC basically has been paralyzed by partisan gridlock and dysfunction in the nation’s capital. It doesn’t have enough commissioners to make rulings or punish violators of election law anyway.\\n\\n“The FEC has closed its doors. It’s gone defunct,” Holman emphasized.\\n\\nHe questioned whether Yang “could be banking on the fact that there is no campaign finance cop on the beat. There is no enforcement agency to enforce the law. The Department of Justice could step in if it wanted to. But they usually only step in if it’s an egregious criminal violation of the law. This would be a civil violation.”\\n\\nYang’s campaign announced on Monday they received $1 million in donations and 450,000 email entries from his announcement on Thursday through the weekend of what they call the “Freedom Dividend Pilot Program.”\\n\\nThe candidate – speaking with Fox News and other news organizations after a campaign rally Monday evening in Boston--pushed back against the criticism of the legality of his pilot program.\\n\\n“I want people to reflect for a moment on the system we’re in the midst of,\" Yang said. \"If I had $1 million in campaign funds and I gave them to a media company like your employers, no offense, or consultants, or an army of canvassers, then everyone would be like that’s A-OK, but if I give them to Americans to do whatever they like in positive ways that something problematic.”\\n\\n“I want everyone to reflect on that and how bizarre that is,” he said.',\n",

She was fined the maximum possible civil penalty of $1,000 and slapped with a 30-month debarment from federal service.\\n\\nGOP SENATORS INTRODUCE BILL REQUIRING DNA TESTING OF MIGRANTS TO CURB CHILD TRAFFICKING\\n\\nThe OSC filed a complaint against DePaolo in June 2018 accusing her of violating the Hatch Act – which prohibits federal employees from engaging in political activity while on duty or in the federal workplace.\\n\\n“We are very pleased with the outcome of this case and believe the significant disciplinary action imposed against Judge DePaolo is appropriate and warranted,” Special Counsel Henry J. Kerner said in a statement.\\n\\nAccording to the OSC, DePaolo violated the Hatch Act as she presided over a March 2016 public deportation hearing for an individual facing deportation and a 10-year ban on reentry into the United States.\\n\\nThe judge, the watchdog said, called that punishment “a pretty harsh thing” and said that Clinton intended to change that if she won.

The very nature of her offense politicizes the judiciary and the federal workforce and militates toward a more severe sanction,” the decision said. “This conduct sends a bad message to subordinates, and possibly instills the notion that political activity is allowed at work. If a judge can say it from the bench, what stops other employees from making these statements in the office?”\\n\\nDePaolo served as a judge on the Otay Mesa Immigration Court in California.\\n\\nThe OSC said DePaolo is now retired but did not say when she left the court.

       "  'text': \"Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., is telling House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., that if he does not have time to impeach Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, he should find someone who does.\\n\\nHarris cited details from a recent New York Times report on allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh, particularly those involving Deborah Ramirez, who accused him of exposing himself to her at a college party. Nadler said Monday, in response to being asked if he would impeach Kavanaugh, that his committee has its “hands full” with impeaching President Trump.\\n\\n2020 DEMOCRATS IGNORE KAVANAUGH STORY CORRECTION AFTER DEMANDING IMPEACHMENT\\n\\n“I understand that the House Judiciary Committee has limited resources and many other responsibilities,” Harris said in a letter to Nadler sent Tuesday. “However, in the past, congressional committees have dedicated resources and established structures to pursue serious cases of misconduct — including by creating a task force and retaining outside counsel to help lead impeachment inquiries.”\\n\\nHarris said Kavanaugh’s lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court “warrants a similarly rigorous approach.”\\n\\nRamirez’s allegations were known during Kavanaugh’s confirmation process, but Harris pointed to information in the Times' report to claim that they were not properly investigated.\\n\\n“Notably, it was reported that two FBI agents interviewed Ms. Ramirez about the event and found her credible, but lacked authorization to review her account any further,” Harris said, citing the report, adding that Ramirez’s lawyers reportedly provided the FBI with at least 25 names of those who could have had corroborating evidence, only for the FBI to interview none of them.\\n\\nNow, Harris wants the House Judiciary Committee to investigate how and why the FBI was limited in the scope of its investigation, anything related from the interviews the FBI did conduct, whether or not Kavanaugh was truthful during the confirmation process, and “[a]ny additional information that may be provided by potential witnesses to the sexual assault allegations[.]”\\n\\nHarris, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election, is not the only candidate calling for Kavanaugh’s impeachment. Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J.; Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-Texas, and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro all called for impeachment after the initial Times report.\\n\\nHarris has continued to push for impeachment, despite the Times later updating the piece with information that the alleged victim in a separate reported incident declined to be interviewed and her friends said she did not recall the incident.\\n\\nGOP LEADERS DECRY KAVANAUGH ATTACKS AS MCCONNELL SAYS 'THIS IS NOT NORMAL POLITICAL BEHAVIOR'\\n\\nHarris’ Democratic colleague, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., has come out against the calls for impeachment.\\n\\n“We’ve got to get beyond this ‘impeachment is the answer to every problem,” Durbin said, according to Politico. “It’s not realistic. If that’s how we are identified in Congress, as the impeachment Congress, we run the risk that people will feel we’re ignoring the issues that mean a lot to them as families.”\\n\\nGOP lawmakers quickly rallied around Kavanaugh Monday and vowed to fight any impeachment effort.\\n\\nSouth Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, the current Judiciary Committee chairman who mounted one of the most passionate defenses of Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing, called the attacks “beyond the pale.”\\n\\n“My heart goes out to Justice Kavanaugh’s family for being forced to endure this ridiculous treatment once again,” he tweeted.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nTuesday also saw news that Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., is planning on introducing a resolution in the House calling for Nadler’s committee to conduct an impeachment inquiry related to the allegations against Kavanaugh.\\n\\nPresident Trump, meanwhile, continued to speak out against the Times over its reporting, suggesting that Kavanaugh sue for libel and calling the newspaper itself a “journalistic disaster.”\\n\\nFox News' Gregg Re, Judson Berger, Chad Pergram, and Edmund DeMarche contributed to this report.\",\n",

Monday’s speech, and the big crowd it attracted, was in part an attempt to rebut such doubts by arguing that liberal women have won big change before. … ‘In fact, we’re not here because of men at all — we’re here because of some hard-working women.’ The comments were a more direct nod to gender than most of her public remarks to date, which typically focus on the ways in which powerful interests have tilted the country’s government toward elites.”\\n\\n\\n\\nSwing-district Dems fret over Warren, Sanders - McClatchy: “When the top Democratic presidential candidates gathered in Houston last week, they debated a radical health care overhaul and mandatory gun confiscation while striking an uncompromising tone toward President Donald Trump and the Republican Party. About 15 miles away, the message from a lesser-known but still-important Democrat was decidedly different. ‘I see that over and over again, where people treat folks on the other side of the aisle not like Tip O’Neill and Ronald Reagan, where they could sit down and talk about things, but as you’re an enemy of my country and an enemy of me,’ Sri Preston Kulkarni… [Kulkarni] is pushing for the need for compromise while running in Texas’ 22nd district, which is expected to be among the top House battlegrounds in 2020. … It’s a disconnect some Democratic operatives worry will harm the party’s chances as they seek to maintain their House majority and take control of the Senate.”\\n\\n\\n\\nTRUMP VOWS TO FLIP NEW MEXICO\\n\\nAlbuquerque Journal: “In his first visit to New Mexico since winning the White House, President Donald Trump Monday night pledged to ‘campaign for every vote’ and defy political pundits by adding the state to his win column in 2020. During a rally at the Santa Ana Star Center attended by an estimated 9,000 people, Trump touted an oil drilling boom in southeast New Mexico that has driven state revenue levels to an all-time high and cited a spike in business applications statewide before asking the crowd to ‘give me a little bit more time.’ ‘The Democrats want to completely annihilate New Mexico’s economy,’ he said. ‘But … New Mexico will never give them the chance.’ Last year, Democrats swept all statewide offices on the ballot in New Mexico and the state currently has all-Democratic congressional delegation.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump woos deep-pocketed California donors in secret - San Jose Mercury News: “Less than 24 hours before President Trump is arriving in the Bay Area for his first visit to the region as president, not even the Republican donors who’ve paid thousands of dollars to dine with him know where his fundraiser is going to be held. Attendees who RSVP’d for the luncheon — where tickets are going for up to $100,000 — were told to arrive at a Palo Alto drop-off point Tuesday morning before being transported to the secret fundraiser location, according to an email forwarded to the Bay Area News Group by an attendee. It’s a level of secrecy that seems designed in part to thwart anti-Trump protesters from the heavily Democratic area who are hoping to send the president a message.”\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE RULEBOOK: MARK IT DOWN\\n\\n“If we resort for a criterion to the different principles on which different forms of government are established, we may define a republic to be, or at least may bestow that name on, a government which derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the people, and is administered by persons holding their offices during pleasure, for a limited period, or during good behavior.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 39\\n\\n\\n\\nTIME OUT: COKIE ROBERTS, R.I.P.\\n\\nNPR: “Veteran journalist Cokie Roberts, who joined an upstart NPR in 1978 and left an indelible imprint on the growing network with her coverage of Washington politics before later going to ABC News, has died. She was 75. Roberts died Tuesday due to complications from breast cancer, according to a family statement. A bestselling author and Emmy Award winner, Roberts was one of NPR\\'s most recognizable voices and is considered one of a handful of pioneering female journalists — along with Nina Totenberg, Linda Wertheimer and Susan Stamberg — who helped shape the public broadcaster\\'s sound and culture at a time when few women held prominent roles in journalism. … Roberts won numerous awards during her long career in journalism, including three Emmys and the Edward R. Murrow award. She was inducted into the Broadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame. She was recognized by the American Women in Radio and Television as one of the 50 greatest women in the history of broadcasting.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFlag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.\\n\\n\\n\\nSCOREBOARD\\n\\nDEMOCRATIC 2020 POWER RANKING\\n\\nBiden: 29 points\\n\\nWarren: 18.6 points\\n\\nSanders: 15 points\\n\\nHarris: 6.8 points\\n\\nButtigieg: 5.2 points\\n\\n[Averages include: CNN, ABC News/WaPo, IBD, Quinnipiac University and USA Today/Suffolk University.]\\n\\n\\n\\nTRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE\\n\\nAverage approval: 40 percent\\n\\nAverage disapproval: 54.8 percent\\n\\nNet Score: -14.8 percent\\n\\nChange from one week ago: up 1.2 points\\n\\n[Average includes: NPR/PBS/Marist: 41% approve - 54% disapprove; CNN: 42% approve - 54% disapprove; ABC News/WaPo: 40% approve - 55% disapprove; IBD: 39% approve - 55% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 38% approve - 56% disapprove.]\\n\\n\\n\\nWANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\\n\\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s outspoken former campaign manager, is scheduled to appear Tuesday to discuss the report by former special counsel Robert Mueller. But it’s unlikely that Democrats will get much new information. A devoted friend and supporter of the Republican president, Lewandowski isn’t expected to elaborate much beyond what he told Mueller’s investigators last year. Mueller himself testified this summer, with no bombshells. Two other witnesses who were subpoenaed alongside Lewandowski — former White House aides Rick Dearborn and Rob Porter — won’t show up at all, on orders from the White House.”\\n\\n\\n\\nLocal prosecutors may break Trump’s tax return blockade - NYT: “State prosecutors in Manhattan have subpoenaed President Trump’s accounting firm to demand eight years of his personal and corporate tax returns, according to several people with knowledge of the matter. The subpoena opens a new front in a wide-ranging effort to obtain copies of the president’s tax returns, which Mr. Trump initially said he would make public during the 2016 campaign but has since refused to disclose. The subpoena was issued by the Manhattan district attorney’s office late last month, soon after it opened a criminal investigation into the role that the president and his family business played in hush-money payments made in the run-up to the election.”\\n\\n\\n\\nDEM LEADERS TRY TO NIX KAVANAUGH IMPEACHMENT PUSH\\n\\nPolitico: “Senior Democrats are moving quickly to snuff out calls to impeach Brett Kavanaugh, arguing those tactics are unrealistic and politically harmful. Democrats are already wrestling with whether to try to oust President Donald Trump, and leadership sees little room for the party to take on a second divisive impeachment saga barely a year before the presidential election. So the demands by 2020 presidential contenders to remove the Supreme Court justice, on the heels of new reporting about allegations of sexual misconduct, are getting panned. ‘Get real,’ as Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) put it Monday afternoon. ‘We’ve got to get beyond this ‘impeachment is the answer to every problem.’ It’s not realistic,’ Durbin said. … Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) said she will file an impeachment resolution on Tuesday… The two-page resolution calls on the House Judiciary Committee to investigate whether Kavanaugh should be impeached, according to a draft obtained by POLITICO.”\\n\\n\\n\\nOcasio-Cortez backs first 2020 challenger to an incumbent - NYT: “Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez plans on Tuesday to announce her endorsement of Marie Newman, a progressive candidate seeking to oust Representative Daniel Lipinski, a conservative-leaning Illinois Democrat, marking her first move of the 2020 campaign cycle to back a primary challenger to an incumbent. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s high-profile support amounts to a powerful seal of approval, telegraphed to her legions of ardent liberal fans, on behalf of Ms. Newman, and a reflection of the zeal of the party’s progressive left to leverage its nascent power to continue targeting sitting Democrats. Ms. Newman is backed by Justice Democrats, the group that propelled Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s insurgent campaign and upset victory last year over a veteran Democratic congressman who she argued was out of step with his constituents.”\\n\\n\\n\\nGOPERS SHARPEN ATTACKS IN LOUISIANA GOVERNOR RACE\\n\\nAP: “Louisiana gubernatorial candidate Eddie Rispone is launching a TV attack ad against his fellow GOP contender, U.S. Rep. Ralph Abraham, ending Republican Party leaders’ efforts to keep their two main candidates from a slugfest ahead of the Oct. 12 election. Rispone’s 30-second spot, which his campaign said will start airing Tuesday, pans Abraham for reneging on a promise to donate his congressional salary to charity and for missing congressional votes. It says he voted with Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi hundreds of times. The ad also hits Abraham, a third-term congressman from northeast Louisiana, for a 2016 statement suggesting Donald Trump should consider stepping aside from the GOP presidential nomination after a recording emerged in which Trump boasted about groping women. … Rispone campaign spokesman Anthony Ramirez said the ad is being paired with a second spot that criticizes Democratic incumbent John Bel Edwards. … Abraham’s campaign didn’t immediately comment about the TV attack.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\\n\\nNetanyahu’s long grip on power tested in unprecedented repeat election - AP\\n\\n\\n\\nNorth Carolina legislature on track to meet redistricting deadline - AP\\n\\n\\n\\nAUDIBLE: GO TELL ‘EM IN TUSCALOOSA\\n\\n“At the end of the day, the people of Alabama, they trust football coaches a heck of a lot more than they trust politicians.” – Republican candidate for Senate Tommy Tuberville, a former Auburn head coach, said on Fox Business Network.\\n\\n\\n\\nShare your color commentary: Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM and please make sure to include your name and hometown.\\n\\n\\n\\nNEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING HAS GOTTEN OUT OF HAND\\n\\nWBBM: “Talk about dumb luck during a Morning Insiders interview – near a very busy Chicago Transit Authority stop nicknamed the ‘pigeon poop station.’ … CBS 2’s Lauren Victory was talking with a lawmaker who was fighting to fix the problem, and he fell victim to it right when the cameras were rolling. That’s right, a pigeon relieved itself on state Rep. Jaime Andrade (D-Chicago) right on cue as he spoke. Andrade had just been badmouthing the pigeons. ‘I’ll just have to go clean up,’ he said. ‘That’s what happens to my constituents. They get s**t on all [the] time.’ Birds are a chronic problem around the Irving Park Blue Line station. Their waste and feathers constantly coat the path commuters take – including suburbanites and tourists who use the nearby Metra stop. … Andrade said he is going back to the drawing board. But first, he needs to hit the shower after being pooped on.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…\\n\\n“Timing is everything.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in Time magazine on March 5, 2007.\\n\\n\\n\\nChris Stirewalt is the politics editor for Fox News.

       "  'text': 'President Trump suggested this week that Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh sue The New York Times for libel after they published a report on alleged sexual misconduct that initially omitted key information that undermined the claim -- but whether this would be a good idea legally is up for debate.\\n\\nThe Times ignited calls from Democratic presidential candidates for Kavanaugh\\'s impeachment after publishing the report over the weekend. Then late Sunday, the paper published a major revision noting the initial version did not reveal that friends of the alleged victim said she did not recall the episode.\\n\\nThat omission could be enough for a libel suit, according to one legal analyst. However, such a lawsuit also could open the door to more testimony from defense witnesses and would place the burden on him to prove the story was false -- essentially meaning he would have to prove his innocence.\\n\\n‘SQUAD\\' MEMBER PRESSLEY PUSHING KAVANAUGH IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, DESPITE ALLEGATION CONCERNS\\n\\n\"He does not want to sue the New York Times,\" Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano told \"Fox & Friends\" Tuesday morning. \"That\\'s going to open up a Pandora\\'s box for him.\"\\n\\nThat being said, Kavanaugh could still have a chance to win if he did sue. In order to prove a libel case, he would have to show that the Times story was false, damaging and, because he is a public figure, meets the higher standard of \"actual malice\" -- meaning they either knew it was false or displayed a reckless disregard for whether it was true. While that normally is a difficult hurdle to overcome, Napolitano said the Times\\' actions could be enough.\\n\\nMOLLIE HEMINGWAY ACCUSES NYT OF HIDIN FACTS AND USING \\'GOSSIP\\' TO SMEAR KAVANAUGH\\n\\n\"Is leaving out of the article the true statement that the victim does not recall this alleged event reckless disregard for the truth? He may actually have a case there,\" Napolitano said.\\n\\nAttorney Robert Barnes, who is representing students from Covington Catholic High School in a defamation case against lawmakers and journalists, had a similar assessment of a hypothetical Kavanaugh lawsuit.\\n\\n\"Yes, he would have a case against the Times, due to their knowing exclusion of a particularly pertinent contextual, exculpatory fact,\" Barnes told Fox News. \"That said, it is rarely a good idea for a Supreme Court Justice to sue over this kind of matter.\"\\n\\nUCLA Law Professor Eugene Volokh was less optimistic about Kavanaugh\\'s chances against the Times, telling Law&Crime.com that the case would be a \"loser\" because he does not believe Kavanaugh could prove actual malice.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nVolokh also told the outlet that it would be a bad idea for Kavanaugh to keep the media\\'s attention on this.\\n\\n\"This too shall pass as all news stories do,\" Volokh said.\\n\\nCornell Law Professor Michael Dorf agreed, saying Kavanaugh would likely want the story out of the news. He also said \"such a case would almost certainly be unwise,\" since it would give the Times the opportunity to seek discovery materials that they could try to use against Kavanaugh.\\n\\nFor the time being, though, the story remains in the headlines as some Democrats try to pressure congressional leaders to launch impeachment proceedings against him.\\n\\nSenate Republican leaders, in turn, have vowed to defend Kavanaugh from such efforts.\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., took to the Senate floor Monday afternoon to decry what he described as a familiar “pattern” involving Kavanaugh allegations: “Shoot first, correct the facts later.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'A new video from President Trump’s reelection campaign takes a big swipe at former Vice President Joe Biden\\'s fitness for office, spotlighting clips of his recent gaffes and other verbal fumbles coupled with copious clips of pundits questioning his readiness.\\n\\nThe web video, tweeted Tuesday morning by campaign manager Brad Parscale and shared first with Fox News, stitches together everything from his recent debate-stage musing about \"record players\" to his statement that \"poor kids\" are just as talented as \"white kids.\" Interspersed with the clips of the 76-year-old Biden\\'s comments are those of pundits wondering about his stumbles, shakiness, mental and physical stamina, whether he’s “lost a step” and whether he’s “equipped for a very grueling campaign.”\\n\\nBIDEN\\'S AGE, MEMORY COME UNDER ATTACK AT DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE\\n\\nThe former vice president’s age and mental acuity have been questioned ever since he launched his 2020 presidential campaign in late April. Last week, the front-runner in the Democratic nomination race faced repeated attacks from rivals over his memory.\\n\\nFormer Housing Secretary Julian Castro, who served in the Obama administration with Biden, landed arguably the lowest blow when he swiped at Biden’s memory -- accusing him of contradicting himself on whether Americans would have to buy into his health care plan.\\n\\nWATCH THE VIDEO HERE:\\n\\n\"You just said two minutes ago they would have to buy in. Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\" Castro asked, in what appeared to be a reference to past senior moments by Biden.\\n\\nIn that case, as the Biden campaign later noted, Castro was wrong. Biden did not say during the debate that individuals would have to buy in. Instead, he said that individuals would automatically be enrolled if they lost their jobs.\\n\\nBut Biden has drawn criticism for other stumbles. And another rival, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, backed Castro after the debate and raised further questions about Biden’s ability to carry the banner for the Democrats into 2020.\\n\\n\"I think we are at a tough point right now, because there’s a lot of people concerned about Joe Biden’s ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling,\" Booker told CNN in an interview. \"And I think that Castro had really legitimate concerns about can he be someone in a long grueling campaign… and has every right to call out.\"\\n\\nA clip of that Booker interview appears in the Trump campaign video.\\n\\nThe jabs from some of his mid- and lower-tier rivals are raising concerns that Biden – if he wins the nomination -- would be weakened for the general election showdown against Trump.\\n\\nBut another rival for the nomination - former Rep. Beto O\\'Rourke of Texas - bluntly tweeted this past weekend \"who the hell cares about Joe Biden\\'s age?\"\\n\\nBiden is far from the only candidate where age is an issue. The president is 72 and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont – another top tier Democratic presidential candidate – is 77. Another top Democratic White House rival, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, is 70. But concerns about their ages have been less of a factor.\\n\\nBoth Biden and Sanders have repeatedly said that age is a legitimate concern in the race for the White House.\\n\\nBut Biden’s been brushing off criticism that he’s too old for the Oval Office. Last Friday he told reporters he’ll prove his fitness through the grinding process that is the presidential campaign trail. And he pledged to release his medical records “when I get my next physical” before the voting begins next February in the Iowa caucuses.\\n\\nThis summer, the doctor who was named the White House physician to the then-vice president, said Biden was in excellent physical condition.\\n\\n“He is more than capable of handling the rigors of the campaign and the office for which he is running,\" said Dr. Kevin O’Connor.\\n\\nThere is no digital ad buy associated with the latest video yet, but the Trump campaign has not ruled one out.\\n\\nFox News\\' Adam Shaw contributed to this report.',\n",

       "  'authors': ['Dana Blanton'],\n",
       "  'text': 'It’s increasingly more important to Democratic primary voters to beat President Donald Trump than support their favorite candidate -- and former Vice President Joe Biden is widely considered the candidate most likely to give them the White House.\\n\\nThat’s a major source of strength for Biden, who continues to lead the Democratic field, albeit at a new low.\\n\\nBiden captures the support of 29 percent of Democratic primary voters, according to a new Fox News Poll. That’s down 2 points since last month and down 6 points since May, when he was at a high of 35 percent support. His current 11-point lead is down from a high of 19 points in June.\\n\\nSanders climbs back into second with 18 percent (up 8 points since August), followed by Elizabeth Warren at 16 percent (down 4), forming the clearest top three candidate tier seen in this race to date.\\n\\nThe next tier includes Kamala Harris at 7 percent, Pete Buttigieg at 5 percent, Beto O’Rourke at 4 percent, Cory Booker at 3 percent, and both Andrew Yang and Amy Klobuchar at 2 percent.\\n\\nMichael Bennet, John Delaney, and Tom Steyer each receive 1 percent.\\n\\nThe top picks among self-described moderates and conservatives voting in the Democratic primary are Biden (34 percent), Sanders (14 percent), and Warren (9 percent). “Very” liberals go for Sanders (31 percent), Biden (22 percent), and Warren (20 percent).\\n\\nPrimary voters under age 35 prefer Sanders (35 percent) over Biden (17 percent) and Warren (14 percent). Those ages 45 and over go even more heavily for Biden (38 percent) over Warren (17 percent) and Sanders (8 percent).\\n\\nBiden is ahead among whites by 7 points (Biden 26, Warren 19, Sanders 16) and non-whites by 13 points (Biden 34, Sanders 21, Warren 11, Harris 9).\\n\\nBy a 25-point margin, Democratic primary voters prioritize supporting the candidate who has the best shot at beating Trump over the candidate they like the most (56-31 percent). That’s up from 15 points in March (51-36 percent).\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS\\n\\nAnd 42 percent say Biden has the best chance of winning. That’s more than double the 17 percent who say Sanders and more than three times the 12 percent who say Warren.\\n\\nAnd yet, primary voters also prefer a candidate who will take a new approach (49 percent) over one who will build on Obama’s legacy (43 percent), and say backing a candidate who will fundamentally change how the political system works (50 percent) is more important than supporting one who will restore the system to how it was before the Trump administration (46 percent).\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nBiden is preferred by a 19-point margin among those who want to restore Washington to pre-Trump, and tops Sanders by a narrow 4 points among those wanting to fundamentally change the political system in Washington.\\n\\nIn addition, those wanting to build on former President Obama’s legacy go for Biden by 19 points, and he holds his own among those wanting to take a new approach: Biden (23 percent), Warren (22 percent), and Sanders (20 percent).\\n\\nDemocrats are pretty pleased with their slate of candidates. Most would be very or somewhat satisfied with Biden (76 percent), Warren (76 percent), or Sanders (70 percent) being the party’s nominee, and about 6 in 10 feel that way about Harris (62 percent), Booker (57 percent), and Buttigieg (57 percent).\\n\\nThe number who would be satisfied with Warren is up 15 points since April. And while overall satisfaction with Biden is down a touch (-2 points), he captures the largest portion saying they would be very satisfied if he is the nominee (47 percent vs. 40 percent for Warren and 37 percent for Sanders).\\n\\nStill, nearly 4 in 10 Democratic primary voters (38 percent) are hoping someone new will enter the 2020 race, including 36 percent of those backing Biden. That’s about how Democrats felt during the 2008 primaries, when 36 percent wanted to see a new face jump in (September 2007).\\n\\nHealth care is the number one “deal-breaker” issue for Democrats, as 13 percent say (without the aid of a list) they must agree with a candidate on it before they can vote for them. That matters, as some of the biggest policy differences between Democratic hopefuls are on health care.\\n\\nEighty-two percent of primary voters favor changing the health care system to allow every American to buy into Medicare, while 74 percent support largely leaving Obamacare in place (Biden’s position). Fewer, although still a 60 percent majority, favor getting rid of private health insurance and moving to a government-run system (Sanders and Warren).\\n\\nAmong all voters, majorities favor the public option (68 percent) and Obamacare (57 percent), while views split on a government-run system (46 favor vs. 48 oppose).\\n\\nPollpourri\\n\\nWhen asked if it would be tougher to beat Trump if Democrats nominate a candidate with certain characteristics, primary voters say the biggest liabilities would be nominating someone who is gay (50 percent), someone who has strongly liberal positions (50 percent), or a woman (49 percent). Fewer see nominating a person of color (39 percent) or a white man over age 70 (33 percent) as disadvantages.\\n\\nConducted September 15-17, 2019 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,008 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters and 4.5 points for Democratic primary voters (480).',\n",

Mark Meadows, R-N.C.\\n\\nDOJ WATCHDOG SUBMITS DRAFT REPORT ON ALLEGED FISA ABUSES TO BARR\\n\\nMeadows told Horowitz that he and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan plan to make a referral to him about inconsistencies in what Comey has said about opening up an obstruction case against President Trump.\\n\\n“I\\'m finding just a number of irregularities,” Meadows said. “So would it be appropriate if ranking member Jordan and I were to refer those inconsistencies to the IG and if we did that with the IG look at those inconsistencies?”\\n\\nHorowitz replied: “It\\'s certainly appropriate for us to get a referral about a then-employee of the department.”\\n\\nMeadows told Horowitz he believes Comey gave conflicting information when his closed-door testimony in December 2018 is compared against what’s in Horowitz’s latest report. That report, released last month, found that Comey violated bureau policies by drafting, leaking and retaining memos documenting private discussions with Trump.\\n\\nMeadows said Comey told lawmakers he denied initiating an obstruction-of-justice investigation because of comments the president made to him.

Horowitz’s team has questioned why the FBI considered Steele a credible source, and why the bureau seemed to use news reports to bolster Steele’s credibility.\\n\\nDOJ USES DEMOCRATS’ IMPEACHMENT CONFUSION AGAINST THEM IN COURT\\n\\nIn his letter Friday, Horowitz indicated that once the Justice Department and the FBI send back a marked document relating to classified material, his team will “proceed with our usual process for preparing final draft public and classified reports, and ensuring that appropriate reviews occur for accuracy and comment purposes.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, a key FBI player during the time frame under scrutiny, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, is facing the prospect of federal charges after Horowitz faulted him in a separate inquiry over statements he made during a Hillary Clinton-related investigation. The review found that McCabe \"lacked candor\" when talking with investigators, but the former FBI official has denied wrongdoing.\\n\\nFox News’ Catherine Herridge contributed to this report.',\n",

       " {'title': 'Inside Trump’s immigration tent courts: Controversial system meant to fast-track asylum backlog',\n",
       "  'authors': ['Adam Shaw'],\n",
       "  'text': 'LAREDO, Texas -- The white tents that sit here on the very edge of the U.S border, with Mexico a literal stone’s throw away, represent one of the jewels in the crown of the Trump administration’s recent efforts to get a grip on the immigration crisis.\\n\\nThey are the temporary courtrooms set up as part of the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) -- known colloquially as the “Remain in Mexico” policy. That policy, established earlier this year, involves sending migrants who are trying to claim asylum back to Mexico during their proceedings -- instead of releasing them into the U.S. while their cases are heard.\\n\\nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION ENTERS NEW PHASE FOR BORDER WALL, SETS AMBITIOUS TIMETABLE AFTER SECURING LAND\\n\\nThis means, officials say, that cases can be heard more quickly -- within as little as 40-60 days, as opposed to the years it sometimes takes after family units are released into the U.S. They say that’s better for the migrants, as it leaves them in limbo for less time. But they argue it also serves as a disincentive for Central American migrants who do not have legitimate asylum claims but might otherwise get into the U.S. by claiming “credible fear” of returning home.\\n\\nThe white tents along the border right now are meant to handle the growing asylum claims, with the backlog now at more than 800,000 cases. The courtrooms recently were set up in Laredo and Brownsville, Texas, but the administration is hoping to set up more such tents across the border soon, expanding amid greater cooperation with Mexico.\\n\\nCUCCINELLI ON CONSTITUTION WEEK\\n\\nYet the proceedings have come under fire from immigration advocates. The group Human Rights First has called them \"secretive\" and described them as part of an \"attack\" on due process within a \"sham\" asylum system. The same group recently charged that they\\'ve been closed to the media and public observers. Advocates see the courts as simply another hurdle for asylum seekers.\\n\\nOfficials sought this week to shed light on the process. Fox News, along with other reporters, were shown the facilities in which migrants wait their turn, and also the rooms where they are put in front of a judge -- who oversees cases via video conference from San Antonio. The facility has a daily capacity of 428, but officials are hoping to expand that.\\n\\nSuch is the courts\\' importance in the multi-layered approach to tackling the crisis that four top officials went to Laredo on Tuesday to tour the facilities and defend the practices to reporters: Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan, Acting U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ken Cuccinelli and Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Matthew Albence.\\n\\n“President Trump is using all the tools available to him and leveraging each federal agency to address the crisis at the southern border,” Cuccinelli said ahead of the visit. “MPP has been a highly effective tool and this visit will help explain the process to the American people.”\\n\\nMigrants who are apprehended at the border and placed under MPP are sent back to Mexico, where the Mexican government gives them a social security number, a work visa, and assists with finding employment. When it is time for their hearing, they cross into the U.S. and into the tent courtrooms (officials call them \"soft-sided facilities\").\\n\\nGOP SENATORS INTRODUCE BILL REQUIRING DNA TESTING OF MIGRANTS TO CURB CHILD TRAFFICKING\\n\\nOn site, migrants are aided by translators and also provided legal counsel. There are private hearing rooms where they can speak to lawyers and also speak one-on-one with a judge. Play areas with books and toys were also set up for children to wait in while court hearings were taking place.\\n\\n“With this facility here, the whole of government approach ... bringing all the resources to bear but still giving them access to counsel, still giving them access to appropriate screening with USCIS, and doing it all here, we’re hoping we’re going to expedite that process, sift out those claims not based on merit and then those claims that are based on merit,” Morgan told reporters at the facility.\\n\\nMore than 42,000 migrants have been sent back to Mexico under MPP -- but it appears only a sliver of migrants ever get accepted and allowed into the U.S. When asked about this, officials didn’t say how many had been allowed into the U.S. via MPP, and the Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review did not immediately respond to a request for that number.\\n\\nAlbence said that many of those put into MPP decide to give up and head home, and officials believe that as that continues to happen, it will stop migrants from making the dangerous journey north from Central America.\\n\\nCritics, however, say that the administration is setting too high of a bar for entry, and have questioned the legality of the program. The program has also come under fire over a series of reports that migrants sent back to Mexico are facing violence when they get there.\\n\\nA lawyer with the National Immigrant Justice Center alleged in an NPR interview that the system is meant to \"foreclose\" asylum.\\n\\nON THE BORDER, OFFICIALS SEE DIVIDENDS FROM TRUMP\\'S DEAL WITH MEXICO\\n\\nMorgan was asked about the reports of violence against migrants in Mexico and said that while the U.S. is assisting Mexico, what goes on inside the country is ultimately Mexico’s responsibility.\\n\\n“We have to be very very careful as our own sovereign nation to paint an entire nation as a warzone,” he added. “I don’t believe that, we are not receiving that information from the government of Mexico.”\\n\\nCuccinelli said that just 6 percent of migrants claim they fear going back to Mexico, and about one in six of those are found to have a reasonable fear of going back while they wait for their hearing. Albence said as well that much of the crisis is fueled by the loopholes still present in the U.S. immigration system, and called on Congress to act.\\n\\nThe courtrooms are just one piece in the jigsaw of efforts by the administration to crack down on the migrant crisis -- and officials have been keen to promote what they see as initial signs of success.\\n\\nThe administration announced last week that immigration officials apprehended 64,006 at the border in August, a 22 percent drop from July and a 56 percent drop from the peak of the crisis in May, when more than 144,000 migrants were caught or deemed inadmissible.\\n\\nOfficials say that the agreements with Mexico in particular -- but also with Guatemala, El Salvador and Panama -- are helping stem the flow as those countries implement policies to staff up their borders and crack down on drug and human traffickers.\\n\\nMeanwhile at home, the Trump administration has moved to end the 1997 Flores court agreement, which limits how long unaccompanied minors can be detained -- and was in 2016 interpreted by a federal court to apply to accompanied minors as well. This, officials say, has produced a powerful “pull factor” that encourages migrants to bring children with them -- even if they are not their own.\\n\\nWhile many of its measures and rules face significant legal challenges, including the Flores rule, last week the administration saw another victory when the Supreme Court upheld a rule that bars migrants from claiming asylum in the U.S. if they have passed through another country.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nWhile it only gives the policy the green light while other legal challenges are ongoing, it allows the administration to bar most Central American migrants from claiming asylum in the U.S. It marked the second administration win at the high court steps in just a few months in regard to immigration. In July, the court ruled that the administration could shift money from the Pentagon to building a wall on the southern border.\\n\\nIn the wake of that decision, the administration is now planning to have 450-500 miles of barriers built along the border by the end of next year.',\n",

       "  'text': 'With President Trump calling for mass resignations at the New York Times and the authors of the Brett Kavanaugh story blaming editors for a glaring omission, the uproar over journalism, the high court and sexual assault shows no signs of fading.\\n\\nIt seems perfectly obvious that there will be no serious movement to impeach Kavanaugh based on the flawed Times story, but many of the 2020 Democrats are still demanding it and Squad member Ayanna Pressley introduced a resolution yesterday.\\n\\nThe president, seizing on a story that had to be corrected in embarrassing fashion, is ratcheting up his rhetoric against his least favorite newspaper. At one point he tweeted that the Times should shut its doors—an astonishing statement except in the wake of his sustained crusade against the paper.\\n\\nHOW I REALIZED THE NY TIMES KAVANAUGH STORY WAS A TRAIN WRECK\\n\\nTrump later modified this, saying at his New Mexico rally that he has “called for the resignation of everybody at the New York Times involved in the Kavanaugh smear story. And while you are at it, the Russian witch hunt hoax, which is just as phony a story.”\\n\\nCalling Kavanaugh “a great, brilliant man,” Trump went on: “They\\'ve taken the Old Gray Lady -- you know, the New York Times, for years, the Old Gray Lady, so prestigious. They have taken the Old Gray Lady and broken her down, destroyed her virtue, and ruined her reputation. She can never recover and will never return to greatness under current management. The Times is dead. Long live the New York Times.”\\n\\nOf course, Trump is happy to quote his hometown paper when it runs something favorable. But the Times provided the ammunition with a piece that left out crucial information from their reporters’ book. The story indirectly cited a lawyer as saying he saw Kavanaugh expose himself at another drunken Yale party, yet left out the alleged victim having told friends she doesn’t remember any such incident.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, author of “The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation,” took to the airwaves to defend themselves and promote their book.\\n\\n“There was zero attempt to mislead anybody,” Kelly told MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell.\\n\\nTo his credit, O’Donnell asked the authors about the critical omission from their newspaper piece. They say their draft included that language.\\n\\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE\\'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY\\'S HOTTEST STORIES\\n\\n“So somewhere in the editing process, those words were dropped?” he asked.\\n\\n“It was in editing — done in haste in the editing process as you know for closing the section,” Pogrebin said.\\n\\nNow that made me feel some sympathy for them, though I fail to understand how an editor could leave in an explosive charge of indecent exposure against a Supreme Court justice but delete the part about the alleged victim not remembering it. And I have to say, as a longtime newspaper reporter, I never let any story be published without looking at the edited version, and sometimes pushed back against mistakes that were inserted or crucial details removed.\\n\\nSome Democrats are still using the controversial piece to call for impeachment. On Rachel Maddow’s show, Kamala Harris demanded an impeachment probe, saying the confirmation hearings had been a “sham process.” Maddow did not bring up the criticism of the Times story or the correction.\\n\\nStill, Democratic leaders have made clear that the impeachment idea is going nowhere. Jerry Nadler said he’s too busy trying to impeach Trump.\\n\\nSome Democrats are complaining that the FBI last year took no action when Sen. Chris Coons wrote a letter about Stier’s account, four days before the confirmation vote. But the bureau, which conducted a limited probe, didn’t have much to go on, and some committee Democrats knew of the allegation and said nothing publicly.\\n\\nOne mystery was resolved yesterday when the authors went on “The View.”\\n\\nThe Times, in promoting the Kavanaugh story, posted a tweet that it later deleted as “clearly offensive.” It said:\\n\\n\"Having a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun. But when Brett Kavanaugh did it to her, Deborah Ramirez says, it confirmed that she didn\\'t belong at Yale in the first place.\"\\n\\nRobin Pogrebin admitted on the ABC show that she wrote the tweet. Her explanation?\\n\\n“I drafted this with this in mind to have actually the opposite effect, which is to anticipate those who would say, ‘A guy pulling down his pants at a party when they’re drunk is on the spectrum of sexual misconduct. It’s not sexual assault. It’s not rape. What’s the big deal?\\'”',\n",

       "  'text': 'Fifty-nine percent of voters are extremely interested in the 2020 presidential election. That’s a number typically only seen right before an election.\\n\\nIt’s 27 points higher than around this same time in the last presidential cycle -- and only one point off the record 60 percent extremely interested the week before Election Day in 2008.\\n\\nIn addition, more Democrats (65 percent) than Republicans (60 percent) are extremely interested in the election and more Democrats (69 percent) than Republicans (63 percent) are extremely motivated about voting in 2020. That helps Democratic candidates top President Donald Trump in potential head-to-head matchups.\\n\\nJoe Biden continues to perform best of the Democratic candidates tested, according to a new Fox News Poll. He has the biggest lead over Trump (+14 points), is the only one to receive 50 percent support, and the only one to keep Trump under 40 percent (52-38 percent). Last month, it was Biden over Trump by 50-38 percent.\\n\\nThe poll, released Wednesday, shows Bernie Sanders topping Trump by 8 points (48-40).\\n\\nElizabeth Warren is up by 6 points (46-40), which is right at the poll’s margin of error, and Kamala Harris has a 2-point edge (42-40 percent), within the poll’s error margin.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS\\n\\nBetween 10-18 percent are undecided or supporting third-party candidates.\\n\\nBiden’s lead over Trump comes from large advantages among women (+22 points), suburban women (+30), and blacks (+74).\\n\\nIn counties where the 2016 vote was close (Hillary Clinton and Trump within 10 points), Biden is ahead by 21 points.\\n\\nAmong the 6 in 10 voters who feel extremely motivated about voting in 2020, Biden is up over Trump by 16 points.\\n\\nTrump is preferred over Biden among whites (+2 points), whites without a college degree (+11), and white evangelical Christians (+41).\\n\\nIn 2016, Trump won whites by 20 points, whites without a college degree by 37 points, and white evangelical Christians by 64 points.\\n\\n\"Democrats are sure to be pleased their candidates have an edge over President Trump in these early trial ballots,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Chris Anderson, his Democratic counterpart. \"But we\\'ve got nine more months of Democratic debates and primaries, and the data show a sense among many voters that by next November, Trump will be the last one standing.\"\\n\\nBy a 6-point margin, voters predict Trump will be re-elected. That’s a reversal from December 2018, when by 13 points voters were more likely to say he would lose.\\n\\nEven some voters who are backing a Democratic candidate think Trump will win. For instance, 16 percent of those supporting Biden in the hypothetical matchup think the president will be re-elected. And it’s about the same for those backing Sanders (15 percent), Warren (15 percent), and Harris (14 percent).\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nPollpourri\\n\\nThree candidates are running against President Trump for the GOP nomination. It’s no contest.\\n\\nTrump captures 86 percent support among Republican primary voters. Former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh, and former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld each receive 2 percent. Another 4 percent say none of the above/other and 5 percent are unsure.\\n\\nEven so, more than one in four GOP primary voters (27 percent) is hoping someone new who they haven’t heard about yet will enter the race -- that includes one in five Republican primary voters who are backing Trump (21 percent).\\n\\nFor comparison, 38 percent of Democratic primary voters want someone new to jump into the race, including 36 percent backing Biden.\\n\\nConducted September 15-17, 2019 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,008 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 23 percent.\\n\\nSouth Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is in third place in the survey at 12 percent. Sen.

Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem!” Trump said. “Knowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially ‘heavily populated’ call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA!\"\\n\\nHe capped off his complaint by declaring: “Presidential Harassment!”\\n\\nThe Post reported that a U.S. intelligence official filed the formal complaint in regard to Trump’s communications with the unnamed foreign leader.\\n\\nNORTH KOREA\\'S KIM INVITES TRUMP TO PYONGYANG\\n\\nThe complaint, in turn, has triggered a showdown with Congress, after acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire would not share details of it with lawmakers.\\n\\nThose lawmakers pressed intelligence community Inspector General Michael Atkinson for details during Thursday’s closed-door testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. The Associated Press reported, though, that he would not discuss the substance of the complaint.\\n\\nAfter the testimony, Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., voiced concerns about not having access to the information, warning Congress could use legal action or budgetary powers as leverage.\\n\\n\"What’s at stake here goes well beyond this complaint and this president,\" he said.\\n\\nSchiff also released letters from the inspector general that revealed the watchdog considered the complaint “credible” and dealing with an “urgent concern.”\\n\\nThe letters revealed the office is now “at an impasse” with the director of national intelligence over disclosure. Atkinson wrote that the DNI, “after consulting with the Department of Justice,” determined the complaint does not have to be shared with the intelligence committees under law. He wrote that he will “abide by that determination,” but disagrees with it.\\n\\nSchiff earlier told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that \"at least according to the director of national intelligence, this involves an issue of privileged communications,” adding, \"I think it\\'s fair to assume this involves either the president or people around him or both.\"\\n\\nHe added that if the “director of national intelligence is going to undermine the whistleblower protections, it means that people are going to end up taking the law into their own hands and going directly to the press instead of the mechanism that Congress set to protect classified information.”\\n\\nSchiff subpoenaed Maguire, saying he was withholding a whistleblower complaint from Congress and questioning whether he had been directed to do so by the White House or the attorney general.\\n\\nIn a letter Tuesday, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Jason Klitenic, wrote that the agency is protecting the whistleblower and argued the allegation does not meet the definition of \"urgent concern.\" He said the complaint \"concerned conduct from someone outside the intelligence community and did not relate to `intelligence activity\\' under the DNI\\'s supervision.\"\\n\\nSchiff said last week that Maguire is required to share the complaint with Congress and said the attempt to hold it back \"raises serious concerns about whether White House, Department of Justice or other executive branch officials are trying to prevent a legitimate whistleblower complaint from reaching its intended recipient, the Congress, in order to cover up serious misconduct.\"\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nFollowing Thursday’s Atkinson hearing, Maguire is still expected to testify publicly about the whistleblower complaint on Sept. 26.\\n\\nFox News’ Catherine Herridge and Matt Leach and The Associated Press contributed to this report.',\n",

Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Oversight and Reform Committee, said he wanted Thursday’s hearing to delve into the ongoing scandal involving D.C. Councilman Jack Evans.\\n\\n51-STAR AMERICAN FLAGS LINE PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE AS WASHINGTON, D.C. SEEKS STATEHOOD\\n\\nEvans resigned from his role as the chairman of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority board this summer after an internal investigation determined that he failed to disclose a profitable conflict of interest. But committee Democrats denied his request, he said.\\n\\n“Sadly the allegations against Mr. Evans are just the latest in a series of local D.C. political scandals,” Jordan said, ticking off several former D.C. city officials embroiled in past scandals. “We cannot and should not ignore these unpleasant facts.”\\n\\nDel. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the sponsor of the D.C. statehood bill and the district's non-voting House representative, pushed back against the argument.\\n\\n“The allegations against Mr. Evans have nothing to do with D.C. statehood,” she said.\\n\\nThe D.C. statehood bill has more than 200 co-sponsors and the support of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, both Democrats. No Republicans in Congress have signed on to the legislation.\\n\\nThe bill calls for districtwide elections of two senators and one House representative. It says all district territory would be included in the declaration, save for specific exclusions of federal buildings and monuments, such as the White House and the Capitol.\\n\\nDemocrats argued statehood is needed because D.C. residents lack adequate representation in Congress.\\n\\n“D.C. residents have all of the responsibilities of citizenship but they have no congressional voting rights and only limited self-government,” the Democratic committee chairman Rep. Elijah Cummings, of Maryland, said in a prepared statement, which was read by Holmes Norton at the hearing.\\n\\nRepublicans said the framers of the Constitution intended for the nation’s capital to be a federal district.\\n\\n“This is not what the Founding Fathers intended,” Jordan said. “They understood and they carefully crafted the Constitution so that the seat of the federal government would purposely and specifically not be within a state.”\\n\\nIf D.C. were to become a state, Democrats would likely gain two new senators and one House representative -- a reality which has played into the political motivations behind supporting or opposing it.\\n\\nRepublican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, has vowed to oppose the statehood bill.\\n\\nSpeaking to Fox News’ Laura Ingraham this summer, McConnell said Democrats want D.C. statehood so they can get “two new Democratic senators” and said “as long as I’m the majority leader of the Senate, none of that stuff is going anywhere.”\\n\\nEven if that bill passed through Congress, it would almost certainly be challenged in court, with some legal scholars saying it would require a constitutional amendment to be implemented. The 23rd Amendment currently gives D.C. the right to vote for president.\\n\\n“In order for the district to become the fifty-first state, Congress needs to pass and the states need to ratify an amendment to the Constitution,” Jordan said.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nD.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser and D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson – both Democrats – testified in support of the bill, with Roger Pilon of the libertarian Cato Institute speaking in opposition.\\n\\nIn a controversial move ahead of the hearing, the city of D.C. ordered about 140 American flags bearing an extra star to represent D.C. The flags were displayed by the city along Pennsylvania Avenue. Bowser led a caravan toward the U.S. Capitol on Monday to symbolize the city's fight for congressional voting rights.\\n\\nThe Washington Post reported that mayoral spokeswoman LaToya Foster said the event and flags cost about $31,200, which came out of the $1 million that city lawmakers set aside to fight for statehood.\\n\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Many voters are frustrated with how the federal government is working and a growing number are nervous about the economy -- yet ratings of economic conditions remain higher than before President Trump took office, according to the latest Fox News Poll.\\n\\nWhile 37 percent feel confident about the economy, 48 percent feel nervous. That’s up from a low of 43 percent nervous in March 2019. At the highest point, 70 percent felt nervous in 2010 when the question was first asked, and it was 61 percent as recently as 2016.\\n\\nThe poll, released Thursday, also finds the president’s economic policies receive mixed reviews: 43 percent think Trump’s policies are hurting the economy, while 39 percent say helping.\\n\\nViews are more negative on tariffs, as voters think they hurt rather than help the economy by a 45-31 percent margin.\\n\\nDespite those concerns, the economy barely makes the top five when voters are asked, without prompting from a list, the most important issue facing the country. Immigration is the most frequently mentioned at 13 percent. No other issue hits double-digits. Next is gun violence (9 percent), health care (8 percent), opposing Trump (8 percent), and the economy (7 percent).\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS\\n\\nAbout half (48 percent) think the president has “a lot” of power over the economy, and 47 percent rate the economy as excellent or good. That number has only been higher three times in the last decade and those were under the Trump administration. Fifty-one percent say the economy is in only fair or poor shape.\\n\\nThat adds up to positive ratings for Trump’s handling of the economy: 50 percent of voters approve vs. 45 percent disapprove.\\n\\nHis job ratings on every other issue tested are underwater: national security (45 approve-48 disapprove), immigration (42-54), international trade (38-53), foreign policy (36-54), guns (35-56), health care (34-56), and Afghanistan (31-49).\\n\\nCurrently, 45 percent approve of the overall job the president’s doing, while 54 percent disapprove. Last month, it was 43-56 percent.\\n\\nIn addition, 65 percent are dissatisfied (36 percent) or angry (29 percent) with the government. That’s more than twice the 31 percent who feel satisfied (24 percent) or enthusiastic (7 percent).\\n\\nThe 29 percent angry is a new high and the 7 percent enthusiastic matches the previous high set a year ago.\\n\\nAbout two-thirds (64 percent) think many people -- if not nearly all people -- in government are corrupt, and almost half (46 percent) say the Trump administration is more corrupt than previous ones. Another 25 percent say this White House is less corrupt than others and 24 percent think it’s about the same.\\n\\nBy a 46-25 percent margin, voters say their opinions of Trump have gotten worse rather than better since he took office.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nMeanwhile, 37 percent say the Trump administration makes them feel more energized about politics, but for a 52 percent majority it makes them feel more exhausted.\\n\\nViews among partisans\\n\\nApproval of the president’s job performance matches the record high of 89 percent among Republicans, compared to 37 percent among independents and 12 percent among Democrats.\\n\\nOver half of Republicans (52 percent) say their perception of Trump has gotten better since he took office, 10 percent say worse, and 38 percent unchanged. For Democrats, 5 percent say better, 75 percent worse, and 19 percent unchanged.\\n\\nEven with their high approval of the president, just 15 percent of Republicans are enthusiastic about how the government is working, with another 41 percent “satisfied.” Most Democrats are dissatisfied (43 percent) or angry (41 percent).\\n\\nViews on the economy are driven heavily by partisanship: Republicans (75 percent) are more than twice as likely as Democrats (28 percent) to rate the economy positively. And, while 69 percent of Republicans feel confident in the economy, 70 percent of Democrats feel nervous.\\n\\nThe top three issues identified among Democrats are Trump (14 percent), guns (11 percent), and health care (10 percent). For Republicans, it’s immigration (23 percent), the economy (8 percent), and national security (7 percent).\\n\\nPollpourri\\n\\nVoters see several threats to the stability of the United States.\\n\\nNearly 6-in-10 see corporate influence over government (59 percent), racism (58 percent), and foreign interference in U.S. elections (56 percent) as major threats to the country.\\n\\nHalf perceive climate change (50 percent) as a major threat, and nearly half say the same about political polarization (48 percent), illegal immigration (47 percent), illegal voting (47 percent), and income inequality (45 percent). Fewer feel that way about socialism (39 percent major threat) and political correctness (36 percent).\\n\\nSocialism has the largest number, 28 percent, saying it is not a threat at all. However, it ranks as the third biggest threat among Republicans: 74 percent say illegal immigration is a major threat to the stability of the U.S., 65 percent say illegal voting, and 63 percent socialism. The top three major threats among Democrats are racism at 78 percent, foreign interference in elections at 74 percent, and 72 percent climate change.\\n\\nConducted September 15-17, 2019 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,008 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.',\n",

If convicted of the federal charge, Buck faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison.\\n\\nState prosecutors described Buck as a “violent, dangerous sexual predator” who offered drugs, money and shelter to mainly addicted and homeless men in exchange for participating in sexual fetishes.

And as for a strong statement from our office, you have our bail motion that spells out what you are looking for.”\\n\\nBuck was arrested Tuesday after a third man reportedly suffered a methamphetamine overdose inside his home last week — and survived. Another man, 55-year-old Timothy Dean, overdosed and died at the home in January 2018.\\n\\nBuck, 65, has donated tens of thousands of dollars to California candidates, including Democratic Gov.

       "  'text': 'President Trump filed a lawsuit against his own accounting firm, Mazars USA, and Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance in federal court on Thursday in an effort to prevent the release of his tax returns.\\n\\nThe lawsuit, filed in Manhattan federal court and obtained by Fox News, was in response to Vance’s move to subpoena Mazars for eight years of the president’s personal and corporate tax returns as part of an investigation into potential campaign finance violations.\\n\\n“In response to the subpoenas issued by the New York County District Attorney, we have filed a lawsuit this morning in Federal Court on behalf of the President in order to address the significant constitutional issues at stake in this case,” Trump attorney Jay Sekulow told Fox News Thursday.\\n\\nThe filing by Trump\\'s legal team claims the subpoena for his tax returns are \"unconstitutional\" while the president is in office. It also asks the court to order a \"permanent injunction staying the subpoena while the president is in office.\" Trump\\'s lawyers also claimed that Vance was running a \"harassment\" campaign against the president.\\n\\nTrump attorney Marc Mukasey told Fox News that \"We are in court to protect the President\\'s rights and the Constitution.\"\\n\\nVance has until the close of business Monday to file a response to Trump\\'s motion for a temporary restraining order, and Trump\\'s legal team must reply by the end of the day Tuesday.

As a matter of firm policy and professional rules, we do not comment on the work we conduct for our clients.”\\n\\nThe subpoenas to Mazars were reportedly issued late last month after the district attorney’s office opened a criminal investigation into the role that the president and The Trump Organization played in hush-money payments ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\\n\\nFormer Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen orchestrated a payment of $130,000 to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who said she had a sexual encounter with the president in 2006, in the weeks prior to the election.

       "  'text': \"EXCLUSIVE: Former GOP Rep. Darrell Issa’s confirmation hearing for a top trade position in the Trump administration was indefinitely delayed Thursday after Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member Bob Menendez insisted on the release of an FBI background file that sources say shows Issa used a fake ID when he was 17.\\n\\nIssa, the colorful former chairman of the House Oversight Committee, was nominated a year ago to be director of the U.S. Trade and Development Agency. With the confirmation process at a crawl, he's already signaled he's ready to move on, creating an exploratory committee for a potential run against embattled Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif.\\n\\nISSA LAUNCHES EXPLORATORY COMMITTEE\\n\\nAsked Thursday about the latest delay, Issa told Fox News: “My desire is to serve the president and help in any way I can. If it becomes my best course to take a congressional seat and help take back the majority in the House, that’s OK, too.”\\n\\nThe focus on the fake ID he used as a 17-year-old Army private raised eyebrows, considering Issa had a well-known history of run-ins with the law when he was a teenager involving more serious accusations.\\n\\nBut, during the confirmation hearing on Thursday, Menendez, D-N.J., argued that the committee did not have access to the information needed to determine whether Issa could be confirmed to his post, and said there was “problematic” information from his FBI background investigation that could be “potentially disqualifying.”\\n\\nAn official familiar with the situation told Fox News that Menendez, Issa and Committee Chairman Jim Risch, R-Idaho, met on the sidelines of the hearing to discuss the file, which also includes Issa's other legal run-ins.\\n\\nThe official told Fox News that the specific issue Menendez was citing was a falsified military ID card that Issa used when he was a 17-year-old private. According to the official, in the early 1970s, when Issa was stationed near Pittsburgh, he had a military ID that said he was two years older. The official said Issa, at the time, was disciplined by the lieutenant in charge, who was “not amused.”\\n\\n“It was a military ID where the ID office had put the wrong birthday on, which made Issa look older,” the official said.\\n\\nThe official said the ID was “completely authentic and legitimately issued,” but someone did a “little maneuver” in the ID office to help Issa to “go into bars.” According to the official, the Army, at the time, “always observed 18 for drinking a beer on base.”\\n\\nIssa was from Ohio, where the drinking age was 18 for 3.2 percent beer at the time, but in Pittsburgh, the legal drinking age was 21.\\n\\nOn the sidelines of the hearing, Menendez pressed Issa. According to the official, he said, “If you would falsify records when you were 17, how can we believe you’re credible to be honest now?”\\n\\nRepresentatives for Risch and Menendez did not comment for this report.\\n\\nIssa has a record of criminal cases against him as a teenager, including arrests in the early 1970s — twice on unregistered firearm charges and twice on grand theft auto charges, though prosecutors ultimately dropped those charges.\\n\\n“The whole issue involving Mr. Issa’s FBI background check revolves around when he was caught using a fake ID as a 17-year-old,” a source with direct knowledge of the confirmation hearing proceedings told Fox News. “It’s ridiculous that an embattled elected official like Senator Menendez is holding up Mr. Issa’s confirmation for something so petty.”\\n\\nThe source added: “There is absolutely nothing to see in Mr. Issa’s file that hasn’t been litigated before.”\\n\\nThe official told Fox News that Issa had been granted security clearances long after the offenses in the 1970s. Issa was granted clearances while serving in the U.S. Army and as a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.\\n\\nMenendez has had well-publicized legal battles of his own. Federal prosecutors pursued a major bribery and corruption case against him over favors for and from a Florida ophthalmologist and friend of the senator. But a mistrial was declared in 2017 after the jury failed to reach a verdict, and federal prosecutors later said they would not retry him.\\n\\n“From the very beginning, I never wavered in my innocence and my belief that justice would prevail,” Menendez said at the time.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nMenendez was re-elected to the Senate last November.\\n\\nIssa retired from Congress prior to his trade post nomination.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Former Vice President Joe Biden went on the offense Saturday over President Trump’s July phone call with the president of Ukraine, in which Trump reportedly urged the leader to investigate Biden’s son’s dealings in the country -- with Biden backing calls for a House investigation and for the White House to release the transcript of the call.\\n\\n“Trump’s doing this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum, and he’s using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,” he told reporters in Iowa.\\n\\nNEW DETAILS REPORTED ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT\\n\\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden.\\n\\nJoe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has faced scrutiny for months over his role as VP in pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to Hunter. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as vice president, worked to protect the company from investigation.\\n\\nOn Saturday, Biden said that he had never spoken to Hunter about his business dealings in Ukraine, and backed calls for the House to investigate -- as well as suggesting it could begin a path to impeachment.\\n\\n“Depending on what the House finds, he could be impeached but I’m not making that judgment now,” he said. “The House should investigate it, this appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power.”\\n\\nHe went on to call Trump a “serial abuser.”\\n\\n“He abuses power everywhere he can and if he sees any threat to staying in power, he’ll do whatever he has to do -- but this crosses the line,” he said.\\n\\nCONTROVERSY OVER TRUMP PHONE CALL CENTERS ON UKRAINE, AS PRESIDENT DECRIES \\'PARTISAN\\' COMPLAINT\\n\\nBiden’s remarks came just hours after Trump dismissed the controversy as a “Ukraine Witch Hunt” being stoked by the Democratic Party and the “fake news media,” and said that the real scandal was to do with Biden’s interactions in the country.\\n\\n“The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son, or they won’t get a very large amount of U.S. money, so they fabricate a.story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation I had with the new President of the Ukraine,” he tweeted.\\n\\n“Nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden’s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster. The Fake News knows this but doesn’t want to report!”\\n\\nWhat initially touched off the controversy is a secret whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a \"promise\" Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader.\\n\\nTrump dismissed the story as “ridiculous\" and a \"partisan hack job\" from the Oval Office on Friday and said his calls with foreign leaders are “always appropriate.”\\n\\nThe whistleblower complaint led House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and other Democrats to call for an investigation and for the administration hand over the complaint as well as a transcript of the call -- even as acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire declined to share details with lawmakers.\\n\\nMaguire is expected to testify publicly about the whistleblower complaint on Sept. 26. after being subpoenaed by the House intelligence committee. Schiff had accused Maguire of withholding a whistleblower complaint from Congress and questioned whether he had been directed to do so by the White House or the attorney general.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nOn Saturday Trump said that the media was turning the story into one about him, as they are trying to “protect” the Democratic frontrunner.\\n\\n“Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone ‘bust’ on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt, while at the same time trying to protect Sleepy Joe Biden,” he tweeted. “Will fail again!”\\n\\nFox News\\' Alex Pappas and The Associated Press contributed to this report.',\n",

       "  'authors': ['Ben Evansky'],\n",
       "  'text': 'As world leaders descend on New York for this year’s U.N. General Assembly, the immunity enjoyed by the organization is being challenged at the U.S. Supreme Court.\\n\\nFollowing a devastating earthquake in 2010, Nepalese peacekeepers sent to help instead brought Cholera to Haiti – a disease unknown to the country at the time. Waste from the peacekeepers\\' HQ leaked into the local river and ended up being responsible for ten thousand deaths, with hundreds of thousands contacting it.\\n\\nSTATE DEPARTMENT EXPELS TWO CUBAN DIPLOMATS IN THE MIDST OF UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY\\n\\n\"My father and stepmother both died because the U.N. brought cholera to Haiti.” Marie Laventure, the lead plaintiff in the case told Fox News in an email.\\n\\nLaventure wants her day in court.\\n\\n“Many other Haitians, including Haitian Americans, died as well. This may be the last chance for justice for those hurt by the U.N.\\'s actions. The U.N. must be held responsible so they know there are consequences for the damage they cause in places like Haiti,” she said.\\n\\nThe plaintiffs are hoping the justices will hear their case when they start their next session in October.\\n\\nEdward Flaherty, a Geneva-based lawyer who filed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court on behalf of Swiss NGO, Hear Their Cries, told Fox News that if the case is accepted for review, it “will allow the Court to finally examine the constitutionality of UN immunity.”\\n\\nFlaherty pointed to a case from the last session of the court as a reason to be hopeful that the justices will set a precedent that has so far led to most governments, including that of the U.S., to mostly back the immunity enjoyed by the U.N.\\n\\n“The court recently decided a case in its last term against the International Finance Corp, an arm of the World Bank which enjoys similar immunity to that of the UN, the Court suggested it is not terribly sympathetic to laws that deny litigants their day in court - as UN immunity has done to the injured Haitians.”\\n\\nIn 2016, after years of avoiding any responsibility, then U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon apologized to the people of Haiti for the United Nations\\' role in the cholera outbreak, telling a meeting: “We simply did not do enough with regard to the cholera outbreak and its spread in Haiti. We are profoundly sorry for our role.”\\n\\nJames Haggerty, the lead counsel in the case being brought on behalf of the plaintiffs told Fox News that despite the U.N.’s reassurances and the promise of a $400 million fund, no victim has been compensated.\\n\\n\"The Secretary General has already apologized and accepted responsibility, stating that the evidence showed the U.N. caused the death and illness that ravaged Haiti. Any argument that they haven\\'t accepted responsibility for what they did to the people of Haiti is a fiction. And they had previously agreed to accept liability in exactly these sorts of situations.”\\n\\nHaggerty continued: \"The trust fund was announced with great fanfare, but to my knowledge, it has collected little over 5%. These trust funds are no more than PR stunts -- a voluntary passing of the hat. The UN acts like they owe Haiti only voluntary acts of kindness, rather than an obligation to compensate the victims of this plague. That\\'s why trust funds sit near empty, while the victims of the UN\\'s recklessness continue to suffer. \"Accepting liability isn\\'t a charitable act. It\\'s an enforceable obligation. We believe the Supreme Court is going to agree.\"\\n\\nA spokesman for the U.N. Secretary General asked why the world body continued to hide behind immunity in the Laventure case referred Fox News back to previous statements on the topic.\\n\\nOMAR CALLS FOR UN TO HANDLE MIGRATION CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER\\n\\nCourtney Smith, the Acting Dean of the School of Diplomacy and International Relations at Seton Hall University, told Fox News that the logic for giving immunity to international organizations “ is to facilitate their ability to carry out their duties free of interference by the governments of the places they operate.”\\n\\nHe continued: “These obstacles can be insurmountable if national governments and local actors are able to impede their work through legal restrictions and threats of politically motivated prosecutions.\\n\\n“That being said, immunity must be balanced with accountability. It cannot be a license or excuse for behavior that harms the reputation and impartiality of the organization. Even though immunity is a legal principle, its actual implementation often rests on political calculations.”\\n\\nHaggerty is hopeful the justices will hear his case. “There\\'s a knee jerk reaction to a case against the UN -- that they\\'re immune because they\\'ve always been immune. We fear that\\'s why there\\'s never even been a hearing in open court in this case. We\\'re hoping the U.S. Supreme Court will uphold our right to be heard.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, Flaherty, who has represented several U.N. whistleblowers in corruption and retaliation cases at the World Body, said a court ruling in the plaintiffs\\' favor would be groundbreaking especially in reform of the UN’s draconian practices.\\n\\n“If successful, the challenge in Laventure to U.N. immunity will force the U.N. to dramatically reform its corrupt practices and root out its rogue employees, or else face a tsunami of lawsuits in the US, if not in the other jurisdictions around the world where it operates, which could threaten its very existence.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nFlaherty concluded: “U.S. taxpayers should demand no less from a humanitarian entity such as the U.N. than it demands of multinationals that operate within its borders--obey local laws, or pay the civil and criminal consequences when it doesn\\'t!!”\\n\\nHaggerty warned: “The next Haiti is out there just waiting to happen. Unfettered Immunity is a cancer that is rotting the UN to the core.\"',\n",

       "  'authors': ['Adam Shaw'],\n",
       "  'text': 'LAREDO, TEXAS -- Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan accused \"reckless\" members of Congress of lying in their attacks on agents on the ground who are enforcing U.S. immigration law -- saying it is hurting morale and lawmakers should instead get to work fixing the loopholes in the immigration system that he says are responsible for the crisis at the border.\\n\\n“When you\\'re there every single day and you\\'re risking your lives and you’re doing so with humanity and compassion and yet the very people who are elected leaders are attacking your character, yeh sure it has an impact on morale,” he said in an interview with Fox News this week between meetings with agents at the border. “That’s what they tell me and the leaders in the field are saying the same thing.”\\n\\nINSIDE TRUMP\\'S IMMIGRATION TENT COURTS: CONTROVERSIAL SYSTEM MEANT TO FAST-TRACK ASYLUM BACKLOG\\n\\nMorgan, who has served in both the Obama and Trump administrations, did not mention any lawmakers by name or party affiliation, but referred to comments made by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who has described detention centers as “concentration camps” and has accused officials of forcing migrants to drink water from toilets.\\n\\nWhen he recalled those remarks, Morgan became visibly angry at what he called the \"lies\" being aimed at agents on the frontlines of the crisis -- and didn\\'t hold back in his criticism of those responsible for spreading the claims.\\n\\n“It hasn’t just been a false narrative, it’s a lie,” he said. “I mean when someone says we’re running concentration camps, it’s a lie, it’s not just a false narrative, it’s a lie. When someone says Border Patrol agents are forcing people to drink from a toilet, it’s not a false narrative -- it’s a lie.”\\n\\nHe noted that CBP has conducted more than 4,000 rescues this year -- something he says isn’t publicized by the media enough -- as agents risk their lives in treacherous waters and blistering 110+ degree heat to save the lives of migrants trying to enter the U.S. He gave one harrowing story of cartel smugglers who, seeing CBP agents approaching, threw a paraplegic man into the river so they wouldn’t be apprehended. Agents quickly dove into the water and saved the man’s life.\\n\\n\"You never hear about that, instead you hear these lies that they’re running concentration camps or they call them Nazis,” he said. “But let me ask you this -- If we’re an organization full of Nazis, how do you explain 4,000 rescues? How do you explain the countless individuals that come to our custody sick or with pre-existing life-threatening conditions and we do everything we can to save their lives -- and that\\'s what gets me so frustrated about our own elected officials,” he said.\\n\\nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION SIGNS ASYLUM AGREEMENT WITH EL SALVADOR\\n\\n“If they don’t like it, change the laws. But instead, because they can’t do their job, because they can’t get their act together to do what they need to safeguard and secure this country, they vilify the men and women of Customs and Border Protection, and that’s outrageous, it’s reckless and it’s irresponsible,” Morgan said.\\n\\nMorgan’s remarks came after The New York Times published a story outlining Border Patrol’s “morale crisis” that detailed how morale has plummeted amid the myriad of attacks against them, including how agents have to pick their restaurants carefully when in uniform in case someone spits in their food.\\n\\nAgents interviewed by the Times spoke about how their job had also gone from stopping drug smugglers to taking care of children and giving them formula as the nature of the crisis at the border has changed. Morgan told Fox that agents know that when they are pulled off the frontlines, it is making the U.S. less secure.\\n\\n“They know every minute they’re pulled away to take care of a child, to order baby formula, to change diapers, to act as a quasi-social worker in an environment for the kids and families, they’re pulled off the frontline and they know bad people and bad things are getting through,” he said. “But they would still do that and do that with pride, what really gets them at the end of the day its that vitriol, that rhetoric that\\'s coming from Congress that\\'s attacking who they are and their character, that\\'s what really gets morale down.”\\n\\nMorgan was one of a number of administration officials who was in Laredo this week to meet with officials and visit the Migrant Protection Protocol (MPP) courtrooms that allows asylum seekers to stay in Mexico while their cases are processed.\\n\\nIt’s one of a number of measures taken by the Trump administration that officials are crediting for a sharp drop in border apprehensions. In August 64,004 migrants were apprehended at the border, a number that officials say is still too high but marks a 56 percent drop from the highs of May.\\n\\nAdditionally, efforts to build more miles of wall on the southern border, something that many agents say is a top priority in places such as Laredo, are underway. The administration is promising that the pace of construction is increasing and that as much as 500 miles of new wall will be built by the end of 2020.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nBut with those measures taking effect, officials are keeping their attention on Congress, saying that laws to close loopholes in the law are needed in order to stop the pull factors that are still enticing migrants to make the dangerous, and often deadly, journey north.\\n\\nWhen asked what he wanted Congress to do specifically, Morgan didn’t need a moment to think, quickly rattling off a series of measures he says are needed at the frontline: a permanent fix to the Flores court settlement that limits how long children can be detained, changes to the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) that prevents the U.S. from returning some children to their home countries, a fix to the “credible fear” barrier for asylum claims, and for enforcement agencies to be given more funding to do their jobs.\\n\\nBut given the sharp partisan divide in Washington, Morgan isn’t hopeful that agents will get any help from the halls of Congress any time soon.\\n\\n“They could do that in 15 minutes on one page if they would actually get together and do their job,” he said. “But they won’t. I’ve spoken to many of them and they’re telling me its not going to happen and that\\'s what\\'s so frustrating.”',\n",

       "  'authors': ['Morgan Phillips'],\n",
       "  'text': 'Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders released a plan Saturday to eliminate $81 billion in past-due medical debt, going a step beyond his primary rivals who have called for a government-run health insurance program.\\n\\n“In America today, it is unacceptable that one out of every six Americans have past-due medical bills on their credit report, totaling $81 billion,” Sen. Sanders, I-Vt., said in a statement, adding: \"It is immoral and unconscionable that families across the country are being evicted, having their heat disconnected, or having their already-inadequate wages garnished because of crippling medical debt while the health care industry made more than $100 billion in profits last year.\"\\n\\nSUPREME COURT COULD HEAR GROUNDBREAKING CASE THAT CHALLENGES UN IMMUNITY\\n\\nUnder his plan, Sanders said, the federal government would step in for the individual to negotiate and pay off past-due medical bills in collections reported to credit agencies.\\n\\nSanders also vowed to create a public credit registry to replace the three for-profit credit reporting agencies in order to, as he put it: “remove the profit motive from assessing the creditworthiness of American consumers.” He said the registry would use \"public, transparent algorithm to determine creditworthiness that eliminates racial biases in credit scores.\"\\n\\nThe self-described democratic socialist added that he would exclude medical debt from credit reports and end credit checking for rental housing, employment, insurance and other non-lending practices.\\n\\nBIDEN GOES ON THE ATTACK OVER UKRAINE CONTROVERSY, PLEDGES TO BEAT TRUMP \\'LIKE A DRUM\\'\\n\\nSanders made no mention in the proposal of how he planned to cover the $81 billion cost. According to Reuters, the Sanders campaign has said they would pay for the debt elimination proposal through a tax on corporations based on their pay for chief executives. The details of that proposal have not been released.\\n\\nDuring an interview with Fox News Sept. 3, Sanders acknowledged that $81 billion is \"a lot of money,\" but he added, \"Compared to what? Compared to the $1.5 trillion that Trump gave in tax breaks to the one percent and large corporations. Compared to the billions of dollars that we spent bailing out the crooks on Wall Street 11 years ago. It is a lot of money but I think it’s the right thing to do.”\\n\\nSanders was one of the earliest supporters of “Medicare-for-All,” which would replace job-based and individual health insurance with a government-run plan.

       "  'text': 'Rep. Joe Kennedy III, D-Mass., announced Saturday that he will mount a primary challenge to Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., next year.\\n\\nThe 38-year-old Kennedy -- the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy – formally announced his candidacy at a community center in Boston after weeks of rumors that he was mulling entering the race.\\n\\nAOC ENDORSES ED MARKEY, GREEN NEW DEAL CO-SPONSOR AHEAD OF POSSIBLE SENATE PRIMARY\\n\\n\"Donald Trump has forced a long overdue reckoning in America, and how we respond will say everything about who we are,\" Kennedy told supporters. \"We have to take on the broken system that gave rise to him in the first place — the outdated structures and old rules, the everyday oppressions and injustices that hold our people back.\"\\n\\nShould Kennedy win, he would be the fourth Kennedy to serve in the Senate, joining his grandfather and his great-uncles John F. Kennedy, the 35th president, and Edward Kennedy. Edward Kennedy was the last member of the prestigious political family to run for Senate, winning election in 1962.\\n\\nThe challenge to Markey, 73, is likely to leave local Democrats, including 2020 presidential hopeful and fellow Sen.

One of those groups — Environment Massachusetts — has vowed to raise $5 million to help Markey win re-election.\\n\\nKennedy positioned himself as a more pragmatic Democrat when he was first elected to Congress in 2012, but has since adopted a series of left-wing stances. He has backed impeachment proceedings against President Trump, \"Medicare-for-all\" and the Green New Deal.

He proposed it be held in November.\\n\\n\"I was very disappointed at the Democratic National Committee\\'s refusal to hold a debate on climate change for our presidential candidates,\" Markey said in a video message. \"So today I\\'m challenging Congressman Joe Kennedy, Shannon Liss-Riordan and Steve Pemberton to a climate change debate, and to do it very soon.\"\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n“For the next generation, we can’t wait,” he said.\\n\\nLiss-Riordan, a workers\\' rights lawyer, and Pemberton, a former senior executive at Walgreens, are also challenging Markey.\\n\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.',\n",

       "  'text': \"John Bolton had to know he was sending a message to the man who pushed him out of the White House.\\n\\nAnd a strong message it was, disagreeing with the president on just about every foreign policy hot spot.\\n\\nThe recently departed national security adviser was speaking to a Manhattan luncheon for the Gatestone Institute, a conservative think tank he once chaired. About 60 people were gathered at Le Bernadin, including such hotshots as Alan Dershowitz, former attorney general Michael Mukasey and Newsmax chief Chris Ruddy.\\n\\nSo the leak, in this case to Politico, was inevitable. The former Fox News contributor certainly gets that any words uttered before such a large audience will soon find their way into print.\\n\\nSIZE MATTERS? MEDIA PRAISE ELIZABETH WARREN -- AND HER CROWDS\\n\\nWhat’s fascinating here is that the Bolton broadside comes as Trump’s handling of the latest showdown with Iran is drawing increasing media criticism, especially from the right. The president is essentially in a no-win situation, whether he chooses a military strike against Iran or sticks with diplomacy and sanctions. The neocon wing of the GOP wants him to retaliate for the attack on Saudi oil facilities that our intel agencies are blaming on Iran, and is casting his reluctance as a sign of weakness.\\n\\nBolton told the luncheon that any negotiations were Iran (and North Korea) are “doomed to failure,” according to Politico.\\n\\n“Bolton also said more than once that Trump’s failure to respond to the Iranian attack on an American drone earlier this summer set the stage for the Islamic Republic’s aggression in recent months…Bolton said the planned response had gone through the full process and everybody in the White House had agreed on the retaliatory strike. But ‘a high authority, at the very last minute,’ without telling anyone, decided not to do it.”\\n\\nReporters quickly asked Trump for his response. “John was not able to work with anybody, and a lot of people disagreed with his ideas,” he said. “A lot of people were very critical that I brought him on in the first place because of the fact that he was so in favor of going into the Middle East, and he got stuck in quicksand and we became policemen for the Middle East. It’s ridiculous.”\\n\\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\\n\\nThe president was referring to the Iraq war and Bolton’s role in the Bush administration. Trump ran against that war, and endless wars, and obviously wants to get out of Afghanistan.\\n\\nThe neocons are growing more critical of Trump’s reluctance to pull the trigger in these situations. He even got into a little spat with his pal Lindsey Graham, who said, like Bolton, that the president’s failure to strike back after Iran downed an American drone is what paved the way for the attack that cut Saudi oil production in half.\\n\\nThe Beltway press, as part of an establishment whose kids are rarely sent off to fight, often reflects these pro-war instincts. Iraq, you’ll recall, was going to be a cakewalk.\\n\\nBret Stephens, a conservative New York Times columnist who detests the president, wrote yesterday that Trump’s policy is “locked, half-cocked, and probably bluffing.” He said this president combines “the rhetorical impulses of Bob Dornan with the strategic instincts of Dennis Kucinich.”\\n\\nTrump does like to talk tough with foreign adversaries. And obviously he has ordered airstrikes before. But it’s no accident that he threatened to incinerate North Korea and wound up in a pen pal relationship with Kim Jong-un.\\n\\nAnd yet if he keeps turning to sanctions and diplomacy, does there come a point where he looks like Barack Obama and his Syrian red line?\\n\\nTrump is bound to disappoint the neocons by exercising restraint when it comes to military options, knowing full well that there are unintended consequences that could bog down U.S. troops for years to come. That means he’s likely to face continued criticism from John Bolton, but might be in tune with the war-weary portion of the country.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington (CNN) For all of President Donald Trump\\'s gripes with his predecessor , this could prove the most galling: his entry into television.\\n\\nAfter all, it\\'s that the world Trump has occupied for the better part of four decades. It\\'s there he gained his celebrity, molded his reputation and earned enough of a following to make a presidential bid possible.\\n\\nNow, the man who has consumed Trump\\'s attention for much of his tenure is invading his turf. Former President Barack Obama, along with wife Michelle, are producing partners with Netflix. Their first feature, a documentary about a Chinese-owned factory in Ohio , was announced last month.\\n\\nThe news apparently hasn\\'t pleased Trump. In a set of tweets on Monday, the President urged congressional investigators to \"Look at the Obama Book Deal, or the ridiculous Netflix deal\" instead of looking at whether he committed obstruction of justice during Robert Mueller\\'s probe.\\n\\nLater, Trump simplified things: \"Obama Netflix?\" he wrote, after insisting without evidence he was due to lose billions of dollars as president.\\n\\nIn neither of his tweets did Trump specify what wrongdoing might have occurred in Obama\\'s arrangement with Netflix nor his memoir deal with Random House, which was announced in 2017. Obama\\'s office declined to comment.\\n\\nBut the fresh criticism amounts to the latest evidence of Trump\\'s lingering fixation on Obama, who he\\'s met in person only once since Inauguration Day.\\n\\nHe\\'s accused him of spying on his Trump Tower campaign office. He blames him for a host of foreign policy debacles, from the Middle East to North Korea. And he\\'s claimed his trade policies put America on its heels.\\n\\nThat\\'s not to mention the \"birther\" conspiracy Trump fueled years before vying for the presidency himself, a racist lie he propagated using regular appearances on Fox News and other television programs. His indignation only deepened when Obama made fun of him during a 2011 White House Correspondents\\' Dinner speech and television cameras found Trump scowling in the audience.\\n\\nAt the same time, Trump has sought to dismantle some of Obama\\'s chief accomplishments, including on environmental protections and health care. He boasted on Twitter Monday about outpacing Obama\\'s judicial appointments -- an effort mainly fueled by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has pushed Trump\\'s nominees through in the absence of major legislation.\\n\\nHome turf for Trump\\n\\nIn going after Obama\\'s post-presidency business arrangements with Netflix and Random House, Trump is delving into two arenas -- television deals and book publishing -- he knows well. His book \"Art of the Deal\" and NBC reality series \"The Apprentice\" were critical in creating the exaggerated image of a billionaire businessman that helped propel him to the White House. He remains an avid television consumer, watching hours of cable news a day, though isn\\'t known to read much.\\n\\n\"He in very many ways used television to become president, but then TV kind of became the president, because what he was seeing on TV set his agenda and controlled his mood and determined the world that the rest of us would live in,\" New York Times chief television critic James Poniewozik -- whose book \"Audience of One: Donald Trump, Television and the Fracturing of America\" came out last week -- told CNN\\'s Brian Stelter on the \"Reliable Sources\" podcast.\\n\\nTrump\\'s tweets on Monday targeted deals widely reported to be netting the Obamas tens of millions of dollars. Neither company publicly disclosed the terms of their contracts, but publishing sources placed the book advance north of $60 million for memoirs from both the former President and first lady.\\n\\nMichelle Obama\\'s book, \"Becoming,\" was the best-selling book of 2018 and one of the most popular political memoirs ever. The former president, meanwhile, has been writing his by hand, and it\\'s not expected to be released until at least next year.\\n\\nThe Netflix production deal, announced more than a year ago, led to the formation of \"Higher Ground Productions,\" which will create a broad range of programming for the streaming service. The first slate included the factory documentary, a drama series about women and people of color in post-World War II New York, and a Frederick Douglas biopic adapted from a Pulitzer-prize winning biography.\\n\\nTradition holds?\\n\\nThe Obamas aren\\'t expected to produce programming that is overly political -- a continuation of their preference to largely avoid direct criticism of the current president. That\\'s a pattern other ex-presidents have followed after leaving office.\\n\\nUsually it\\'s reciprocated to an extent by the sitting president, though past leaders -- including Obama -- have blamed some of their predicaments of the men who came before them. None, however, have gone at it with the same gusto as Trump.\\n\\nThe President has only escalated his attacks as Obama\\'s vice president, Joe Biden, vies for the Democratic presidential nomination. He\\'s accused the duo of agreeing to a \"disaster\" Iran nuclear deal that allowed \"pallets of cash\" to be shipped to Tehran, though recently Trump has expressed his own openness to extending the Iranians a line of credit during negotiations.\\n\\nIn talks with North Korea, Trump has lamented the nuclear situation there wasn\\'t handled during previous administrations. He claimed Obama sought his own meeting with Kim Jong Un, the dictator with whom Trump has developed a friendship (Obama\\'s aides deny there were any overtures to Kim).\\n\\nThe only time the men met for substantive talks was at the White House shortly after the 2016 election. Then, Obama warned Trump that North Korea could prove to be his most intractable problem. But Trump has enhanced that warning to claim Obama advised him he\\'d be at war with the country before long.\\n\\nSince that meeting in the Oval Office, the two men have barely spoken. They met in person only once, during the state funeral for President George H.W. Bush, exchanging businesslike handshakes in the front pews of the National Cathedral before the service began.',\n",

That accounts for about 5% of the daily global oil supply, and is the biggest oil disruption in history .\\n\\nThe market reaction would likely have been much greater were it not for the substantial increase in US crude production over the past decade. From 2008 to 2018, US crude oil production more than doubled, from 5 million barrels a day to almost 11 million barrels a day, according to the Energy Information Agency.\\n\\nMuch of that increase has been the result of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. By some estimates, fracked oil wells accounted for more than half of US oil production in 2018.\\n\\nMany 2020 Democratic contenders support a ban on fracking. Recently, two of the top three, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have suggested that as president they would work to ban fracking in the US.\\n\\nBeyond the market implications that such a move would have, it raises obvious political and legal questions, chief among them: Does the President actually have the authority to ban fracking?\\n\\nFacts First: Without an act of Congress, the President could not issue an outright ban on fracking across the US. There are however a number of regulatory and executive actions an administration could take to prevent or shrink the use of fracking technology, particularly on federal land. The problem is that most fracking takes place on private land, and any attempts to limit it would likely face legal challenges.\\n\\nOn Sept. 4, Sanders wrote that \"any proposal to avert the climate crisis must include a full fracking ban on public and private lands.\"\\n\\nTwo days later, Warren struck a similar note, tweeting Sept. 6 that on day one of her presidency she would \"sign an executive order that puts a total moratorium on all new fossil fuel leases for drilling offshore and on public lands. And I will ban fracking—everywhere.\"\\n\\nFirst, a few facts about fracking:\\n\\nFracking is a controversial method of drilling that involves shooting high pressure water, sand and other compounds underground to make small fractures in rock to release oil and gas. While the practice has led to a drilling boom in the US, it\\'s not been without controversy. Specifically, there have been questions about the effect it has on drinking water, and methane emissions, and it\\'s even been tied to a rise in earthquakes.\\n\\nThe US Geological Survey determined that a few earthquakes in Oklahoma have been linked to fracking-related practices -- specifically from the disposal of wastewater -- and the EPA \"found scientific evidence that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances.\"\\n\\nThat, along with rising public concern over the climate crisis, has made fracking a particular target of environmentalists and politicians.\\n\\nBut how far could a president go in simply banning the practice? According to experts, any efforts could present a rocky road of legal challenges.\\n\\n\"A President can\\'t unilaterally ban fracking on private lands,\" says Christopher Guith, senior VP of the US Chamber of Commerce\\'s Global Energy Institute, \"but a motivated President could embark on a regulatory agenda that would make fracking economically impossible.\"\\n\\nGuith noted that these tactics would face a great deal of legal challenges from states, businesses and local governments. That\\'s essentially what happened under President Barack Obama, whose administration attempted to increase regulations on fracking, and yet was largely thwarted in the courts.\\n\\nIn 2015, the federal government issued a series of fracking regulations through the Bureau of Land Management that were meant to protect water resources and force companies to disclose the chemicals used in fracking.\\n\\nWyoming and Colorado filed petitions for judicial review on the new rules and in 2016 a federal district court judge held that the administration\\'s regulations were unlawful. According to the opinion on the case by Judge Scott Skavdahl, the court found \"that the Bureau of Land Management lacked Congressional authority to promulgate the regulations.\"\\n\\nThis story might repeat itself if an administration tried to reinterpret countless federal regulations in, for instance, the Safe Drinking Water Act or the Underground Injection Control programs -- which regulate, among other things, the disposal of wastewater from fracking -- to try and curb fracking on private land.\\n\\nSo how would these candidates look to thwart fracking?\\n\\nWarren\\'s campaign suggested she would focus on getting a bill through Congress, though that would be difficult if the Republicans maintain their majority in the Senate.\\n\\n\"Elizabeth will fight for legislation to ban fracking nationwide,\" Saloni Sharma, Warren\\'s deputy national press secretary, told CNN. \"She\\'ll build on the Obama administration\\'s methane rule and use executive authorities to regulate contaminants to our air and water as a result of fracking and other natural gas operations.\"\\n\\nSanders\\' plan would take similar actions, using rules and regulations -- among other tactics -- like the Clean Air Act and the Safe Water Act to work toward eliminating fracking, his campaign says.\\n\\nAn anti-fracking administration could also try to pass new regulations at the EPA that would make fracking less economically feasible, like the Obama administration tried to do with coal. Yet, without the help of Congress, that route would likely run into similar problems.\\n\\nAfter a cap-and-trade bill died in the Senate following passage in the House in 2009, the Obama administration tried to limit greenhouse gas emissions through the EPA and its 2014 Clean Power Plan.\\n\\nThe plan, however, was immediately met with lawsuits and never took effect . The EPA received a halt order from the Supreme Court in 2016 until a lower court had ruled on it. Eventually the Trump administration repealed the Clean Power Plan while the case was still bouncing around in the courts.\\n\\nIn order to prevent fracking on US private lands, a Warren or Sanders administration would likely have to work through regulatory powers which would ultimately face a myriad of legal challenges. Or they could try their luck in working with Congress to pass new laws on fracking. Any federal regulations, however, would likely be undone by a future administration who supports or is not as hostile toward fracking.',\n",

       "  'authors': ['Josh Campbell'],\n",
       "  'text': '(CNN) Josh Campbell is a CNN law enforcement analyst and former FBI supervisory special agent. His bureau career assignments included serving as special assistant to former FBI director James Comey. The following is an excerpt from his new book, Crossfire Hurricane: Inside Donald Trump\\'s War on the FBI , Copyright © 2019. Published by Algonquin.\\n\\nAs the door of the Gulfstream sprang open, a frigid blast of winter air filled the cabin of the jet. The hissing of its engines soon spooled down to a faded hum, and the security agents on board began making their final preparations for our arrival. They checked weapons, tested radio communications, and ran through the schedule one last time to ensure that every movement was scripted, down to the smallest detail. During this flurry of activity, our main passenger sat calmly in front of me, nodding in rhythm to a John Legend song playing over his wireless headphones.\\n\\nTwo dark SUVs, flanked by police cruisers with flashing lights, pulled up to the stairs of the aircraft, and the lead security agent gave me the thumbs-up. It was only when I hit the doorway that I realized we had pulled directly alongside a Boeing 757 emblazoned with the word TRUMP on the fuselage. I had seen this impressive machine before, during trips that brought me through New York\\'s LaGuardia Airport, and on one occasion I\\'d even caught a glimpse of Donald Trump himself, barreling out of a Chevrolet Suburban driven by Secret Service agents, his phone pressed to his ear as he climbed the jet\\'s stairs, no doubt on his way to yet another campaign stop as he attempted to overcome long odds in a vitriolic election cycle. But now, as I stood there staring at a gigantic airplane with the Trump name painted in gold, I couldn\\'t help but marvel at the showmanship and branding skills of the man who had just been elected leader of the free world. For Comey, it was now time to meet the new boss.\\n\\nIt was January 6, 2017, two weeks before Donald J. Trump would take the oath of office and assume the role of commander in chief, responsible for protecting the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Comey had flown to New York to join his counterparts in the national security community to brief the president-elect and his transition team on their findings on actions the Kremlin had taken to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election.\\n\\nWhether countering terrorists seeking to kill innocent Americans, identifying cybercriminals probing our critical national infrastructure, or uncovering foreign spies working to undermine our sacred electoral process, the mission of the men and women of the US intelligence community is a deadly serious one. The four men who traveled to New York that morning had spent nearly their entire adult lives working to protect the United States from foreign adversaries. They would now channel their expertise into a briefing intended to equip the incoming chief executive with the knowledge and tools necessary to counter an ongoing—and serious—threat to the nation.\\n\\nBut the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation had one additional duty that day, something the chiefs of the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence would get a pass on. For months, a series of memos had been privately circulating among members of the media and across government that contained unverified but explosive charges against then candidate Trump. As the world now knows, Christopher Steele , a former officer with the United Kingdom\\'s Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), had been contracted by a private investigative firm to look into Trump\\'s background. Steele, a veteran operative, drafted a series of memos describing information about compromising material that Russian intelligence services had purportedly obtained on Trump. In addition to outlining allegations of illegal business practices that might result in Russia having leverage over Trump, the \"Steele dossier,\" as it would become known, also included tawdry alleged details of Trump\\'s sexual proclivities and illicit acts conducted while in Moscow. At one point, Steele thought the information so potentially damning that he approached the FBI and provided it with his reporting.\\n\\nIn fact, Steele was not the only one concerned that Trump might be in a compromising position with the Russians. Two powerful Republican senators had already separately approached the FBI director expressing their dismay at the revelations the former British spy had possibly unearthed. In November 2016, when Comey was speaking with legislators on Capitol Hill, Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Richard Burr (R-NC) pulled Comey aside to warn him of something very troubling. Their conversation had gone unreported until now.\\n\\n\"There is some material circulating,\" Burr whispered cryptically. \"It has some disturbing things in it. I just want to make sure you\\'re tracking.\"\\n\\n\"We are,\" Comey said.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t need to know any more about it,\" Burr said, expressing his respect for the FBI\\'s independence in addressing possible counterintelligence threats. \"I just felt like I needed to make sure you were aware.\"\\n\\nThen, in December 2016, Senator John McCain called our office and indicated that he needed to come see Comey. He brought with him a single envelope, the contents of which were a mystery to us as the senior statesman slowly walked past me and down the long walkway into Comey\\'s office.\\n\\n\"He had returned from the annual Halifax defense conference in Nova Scotia,\" Comey later told me, \"and someone he knew had given him Christopher Steele\\'s material. He had read it enough to realize he needed to give it to me.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know what to make of this,\" McCain had told him, \"but I know enough to know you should have it. You don\\'t need to talk to me about it ever again.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" Comey responded. He did not acknowledge that the FBI already had the same material.\\n\\nThe four intelligence chiefs decided Comey should brief the incoming president on the salacious material one-on-one, both because the FBI had originally received the information and because Comey was the only one in the group who was guaranteed to remain on the job when the new administration came in. (Unlike the heads of the other intelligence agencies, the director of the FBI serves a statutorily mandated ten-year term, and Comey was in year three.) Conscious of the personal embarrassment this sensitive brief might cause the president-elect, the FBI director opted to discuss it with Trump separately at the end of the larger briefing on Russian interference.\\n\\nAs our two dark Suburbans neared Trump Tower, we faced a predicament: we were early. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper , CIA director John Brennan, and NSA director Michael Rogers had all flown into Newark Liberty International Airport and were still fighting Midtown Manhattan traffic, even with marked units from the NYPD clearing their path. There was no way Comey wanted to arrive ahead of the others and break the united front the agency heads had agreed upon, and he also didn\\'t want to find himself sitting in some reception room—with Trump transition staffers engaging him in chitchat—something he loathed to his core.\\n\\nI had learned this about him early on in my tenure as his special assistant, when Comey was set to join an elected politician at an event and I\\'d assumed that I should carve out time for the two men to meet privately beforehand to catch up. \"You assumed wrong,\" Comey had said dryly, taking a blue felt-tip pen out of his jacket pocket and crossing that part off the draft schedule before him in an overly dramatic fashion. It wasn\\'t that he disliked the person; he just had little patience for politics. \"I also see you\\'ve seated the two of us together,\" he\\'d said, striking through the seating chart with another stroke of the pen. \"You sit next to him!\"\\n\\nOn our drive to Trump Tower, I asked the agent seated up front to slow our roll, and he eventually found an open space a few blocks away where we could pull over and wait for the others to catch up.\\n\\n\"Do you have the laptop?\" Comey inquired, the third time he had asked me that day.\\n\\n\"Check,\" I replied, pointing to the vehicle behind us, where an FBI communications specialist sat with a secure bag containing a laptop computer that was certified for the transmission of information classified as Top Secret.\\n\\nAlthough the FBI director travels with an array of specialized equipment that keeps him connected 24/7 to the White House and the rest of the nation\\'s command authority, this was the first time in my nine months working directly for him that Comey had ever asked me to make a laptop available to him immediately following a meeting. This may sound like a menial task, but Comey wanted me to understand that it was a vitally important one. Aware of the unprecedented nature of an FBI director confronting a newly elected president with explosive material about his personal life, coupled with the fact that the president\\'s campaign was secretly under investigation for its possible ties to Russia, Comey wanted to make certain that he fully documented the interaction in writing. He would later tell me he knew it was possible the president-elect might one day lie about the exchange if it ever came to light.\\n\\nIt would be the first of many meetings he would feel the need to memorialize.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Comey: I took notes because Trump might lie Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Comey: I took notes because Trump might lie 00:45\\n\\n\"They\\'re two minutes out,\" the lead security agent said over his shoulder, whispering a series of instructions to his team into the microphone clipped to the shirtsleeve at his wrist. He advised us that our vehicles and the three others carrying the national intelligence chiefs were about to converge into one long motorcade and, in a preorchestrated fashion, make the short drive through the concentric rings of Secret Service protective checkpoints. As a sea of tourists, spectators, and protesters watched from behind barricades erected along the sidewalk, the armored battlewagons moved in unison along Madison Avenue, turned left onto closed-off East Fifty-Sixth Street, and pulled up to a side entrance of Trump Tower.\\n\\nBefore stepping out, I handed Comey his black leather binder, which on that day carried the document that would eventually play an instrumental role in his firing.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Former Comey aide: fired FBI director regrets nothing Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Former Comey aide: fired FBI director regrets nothing 04:49\\n\\nIn the lobby, Secret Service agents held two elevators that would take the delegation part of the way up along the residential side of the building. There they crossed over to the nonresidential part and took another set of elevators to meet the Trump team. The group then entered a small, basic conference room. The only incongruous item was a giant, heavy gold curtain that had been draped along the glass wall facing the hallway. Puzzled by drapery that seemed out of place for such a drab setting, the officials were told by the Secret Service that blocking the window would permit the room to be certified for the discussion of classified information. They milled about waiting for the transition team, and were soon joined by President-Elect Donald Trump; Vice President Elect Mike Pence; incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus; National Security Adviser Designate Michael Flynn; Flynn\\'s deputy, K. T. McFarland; then congressman Michael Pompeo; and a CIA briefer.\\n\\nDirector of National Intelligence James Clapper kicked off the meeting, walking the incoming administration through the same intelligence community assessment on Russian interference that President Barack Obama and his team had been briefed on the day before. It was also the same briefing the intelligence chiefs had provided that morning to the \"Gang of Eight\"—a bipartisan group of leaders and intelligence committee chairs and ranking members from both houses of Congress—before we had departed Washington. As Comey told me, and as Clapper has since said publicly, what struck the intelligence chiefs that day was how focused the Trump team was on demanding to know whether any votes had been manipulated—which might thereby delegitimize Trump\\'s victory—rather than on demonstrating concern over the news that the Russians had brazenly attempted to subvert a US election.\\n\\nAt the end of this discussion, Clapper spoke up and told Trump there was one last piece of information they would like to present, but that Comey would prefer to do it alone. Priebus asked Trump if he would like him to remain behind, and Trump dismissively waved him off.\\n\\nAfter the large group filed out, Comey began his prepared remarks. James Comey is not someone who typically walks into a setting having rehearsed in advance his precise wording, but this was no ordinary occasion. When Comey got to the tawdry details contained in the dossier, Trump became defensive, cutting him off and denying the allegations. \"Do I look like the kind of guy who needs prostitutes?\" Trump asked. He then went on to recount, unprompted, a number of allegations against him by various women, which he claimed were all false. Comey indicated that the intelligence community was aware that the claims in the dossier were unsubstantiated, but that he nevertheless wanted Trump to be aware the information was circulating through government and media circles. Trump thanked Comey for the information, signaling the end of the short one-on-one meeting.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Former Comey assistant breaks down NYT bombshell Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Former Comey assistant breaks down NYT bombshell 03:15\\n\\nWhile Comey was still in with President-Elect Trump, it occurred to me that we might not have the luxury of making a clandestine escape. In the weeks since the election, media outlets had set up camp near the elevator bank on the first floor of Trump Tower in an attempt to catch glimpses of the dignitaries paying visits to the transition team, frequently being treated to impromptu press availabilities with Trump and whatever luminary he was meeting that day. I realized that we had not actually inquired of Trump\\'s staff whether he would expect the intelligence officials to join him to address the media. Would the president-elect, with Comey solo at his side, try to preempt the classified document\\'s leaking by taking it head on and describing it to members of the press gathered on the first floor? A president is permitted to declassify anything he wants, but what about a president-elect? Would Trump be violating the law if he disclosed secret information? It was a very real possibility that Trump would then hand the floor over to Comey to describe what he had just been briefed on. Although usually calm, I was suddenly nearing panic.\\n\\nI grabbed one of the Trump staff members nearby and asked whether the president-elect was planning a press availability after the meeting. He shrugged, barely looking up before returning to his phone. Assuming the Secret Service would be aware of any scripted moments for the day, I walked over to three agents who were huddled over what looked like a printed schedule.\\n\\n\"Excuse me,\" I interrupted, identifying myself as a special agent on the FBI director\\'s staff.\\n\\n\"Do you know if the president-elect is planning to hold a press conference after this meeting?\"\\n\\n\"Not that I\\'m aware,\" one of the agents replied.\\n\\n\"Is it possible that may change?\" I asked, attempting to gauge the likelihood of Trump running an audible.\\n\\nThe three agents looked at each other and erupted in laughter. Seeing my quizzical look, one of the agents said, \"I\\'m sorry, man. This guy\\'s schedule changes every two minutes. But, yes, as of this second, we are not expecting him to do any press conferences today.\"\\n\\nOnce safely back in the car, I immediately handed Comey the secure laptop. He didn\\'t say a thing—the first time we had ever climbed into a vehicle without exchanging words—but began typing. He paused every so often to stare out the window as we navigated the city, and then went back to his writing. After about twenty minutes, and following a thorough proofread, he handed me the computer, pointing to the place on the screen where I should begin reading. I was now learning Comey\\'s version of a meeting that would spell the beginning of the end of his career, and one that would mark the start of a veritable hurricane—a torrent of attacks on the rule of law that would risk threatening the viability of our national institutions of justice.\\n\\n\"One of the most bizarre meetings of my life,\" James Comey said woefully before resuming his gaze out the window at the passing cityscape.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Rio Rancho, New Mexico (CNN) President Donald Trump returned to New Mexico on Monday for a lengthy, wide-ranging campaign rally , courting Hispanic voters in a state he lost in 2016.\\n\\n\"Yesterday marked the beginning of Hispanic heritage month. Who is Hispanic?\" he said to loud applause, pausing for a few moments.\\n\\nAs he has at many rallies, Trump touted Hispanic American employment and poverty numbers.\\n\\n\"We got a lot of Hispanics, got a lot of Hispanics. We love our Hispanics,\" Trump later said.\\n\\nHe also spent time during the rally railing at The New York Times, handicapping his 2020 Democratic rivals, touting the US car industry -- even as the United Auto Workers are on strike -- lamenting the emoluments clause of the COnsitution and threatening that Democrats want to \"demolish everything\" that Republicans have gained.\\n\\nMonday night\\'s crowd was diverse, with many supporters holding \"Latinos for Trump\" signs distributed by the campaign, which encouraged attendees to text \"VAMOS\" to a designated number.\\n\\n\"Viva Trump,\" a pastor said after delivering the invocation earlier Monday, prompting raucous applause from the crowd.\\n\\nTrump may face an uphill battle in courting the Hispanic vote, however -- last week\\'s CNN/SSRS poll showed only 29% of Hispanics approve of the job he\\'s doing as President, compared with two-thirds who disapprove. From his initial campaign speech in the summer of 2015, in which he railed against Hispanic undocumented migrants coming into the US and promised to build a wall to keep them out, the President has often made reducing illegal crossings over the nation\\'s southern border a key focus.\\n\\nTrump has made many policy decisions during his time in office that targeted those undocumented people who cross over the southern border, who are overwhelmingly from Central and South American. Among them have been the separation of children from their parents after an illegal border crossing -- which has since been discontinued -- and restricting the ability of individuals who make it to claim asylum. Human rights groups have also slammed the conditions that undocumented migrants face in detention centers after they are arrested for crossing the border illegally.\\n\\nIt was Trump\\'s first trip to the \"Land of Enchantment\" as President, and a sign of his campaign\\'s promise to make a play for the state that voted decisively Democratic in 2016.\\n\\nThe President kicked off a three-day swing out West rallying supporters in Rio Rancho, New Mexico, a suburb of Albuquerque, Monday evening. He will spend the night in the Albuquerque area, then travel to California for a slate of fundraising events Tuesday in Palo Alto and Beverly Hills. Trump will attend additional fundraisers in Los Angeles and San Diego on Wednesday before returning to Washington.\\n\\nHillary Clinton solidly won New Mexico\\'s five electoral votes in 2016; she carried 48.3% of the state\\'s votes to Trump\\'s 40.0%. However, the state\\'s independent voters cast their ballots for Trump 42% to 37% Clinton. The Trump campaign claims it sees signs that the state could be in play in 2020.\\n\\n\"I think New Mexico is a state that Trump\\'s policies are really working with,\" Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale told reporters on a conference call last week.\\n\\nParscale said that Trump\\'s policies on China trade and immigration in particular are resonating with Latino voters, which make up a significant portion of New Mexico\\'s voters.\\n\\nThe President suggested Monday that border security was appealing to Hispanic voters.\\n\\nWhen he first started talking about building a border wall, Trump said, people suggested it wouldn\\'t be popular with Hispanic voters.\\n\\n\"People said, oh, the Hispanics,\" he said.\\n\\nBut, Trump continued, Hispanic voters understand the crisis and drugs pouring across the border.\\n\\n\"You understand that when other people don\\'t understand it,\" he told the crowd.\\n\\n\"We saw thousands of voters who did not vote for the President in 2016 show up to a rally, register, come in line,\" Parscale said, adding, \"We saw thousands of Latina women and Latinos come there that had not voted for him in \\'16 who were not only anxious to vote for him this time, but actually come see him and rally for him. As we then started doing poling there, we started seeing a dramatic increase from our last polling from 2016.\"\\n\\nParscale said he showed these results to Trump \"and he was in agreement with me. \\'Let\\'s go right into Albuquerque, let\\'s go into New Mexico.\\' \"\\n\\nTrump\\'s campaign manager said they had gotten \"one of the best responses\" for campaign rally registration as of last week.\\n\\nTrump vowed Monday he would be victorious in New Mexico in 2020.\\n\\n\"We will campaign for every vote and we will win the great state of New Mexico,\" he said.\\n\\nHe later acknowledged, \"It\\'s been quite a while since a Republican won this state. ... We really think we\\'re going to turn this state and make it a Republican state.\"\\n\\nThe campaign and Republican National Committee have installed a state director, Leslie White, in New Mexico, and announced Monday that state\\'s House Minority Leader Jim Townsend and former state Rep. Sharon Clahchischilliage will be honorary state chairs.\\n\\nAccording to voter registration statistics from the New Mexico Secretary of State, 33% of voters in Sandoval County, where the rally is being held, are registered Republicans as of August 2019. Forty-three percent are registered Democrats.\\n\\nTrump\\'s last trip to New Mexico was met with resistance : protesters lit fires, smashed a door and threw rocks outside his Albuquerque rally in May 2016, the scene of chaos taking place in the weeks after he became the presumptive Republican nominee. Inside the convention center, sporadic protesters disrupted Trump\\'s rally.\\n\\nOn Monday, Trump was interrupted just once by a protester.',\n",

       "  'authors': ['Gregory Krieg'],\n",
       "  'text': 'New York (CNN) Sen. Elizabeth Warren touted her sweeping new set of anti-corruption proposals at a rally Monday night in New York, where she spoke a short walk from the site of an infamous 1911 fire that set off a movement to regulate workplace safety standards\\n\\nAddressing thousands of supporters in Washington Square Park, the Massachusetts Democrat connected the mix of populist rage and insider activist politicking that followed the deadly blaze at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory -- and led to the passage of a raft of new labor laws -- to her broader vision for eradicating corruption in Washington.\\n\\nWarren told the story through the lens of Frances Perkins, who led the charge for change in New York before going on to become President Franklin Delano Roosevelt\\'s labor secretary -- the first woman to hold a Cabinet position -- and an author of the New Deal.\\n\\nPerkins \"used the same model that she and her friends had used after the Triangle Fire: She worked the political system relentlessly from the inside, while a sustained movement applied pressure from the outside,\" Warren said Monday night. \"As Frances Perkins put it, the Triangle fire was \\'the day the New Deal was born.\\' \"\\n\\nWarren\\'s push to combat public corruption by implementing stricter ethics laws has been the central theme of her presidential campaign. Underlying that argument has been a promise to work an inside-outside model of politics, connecting progressive activists with like-minded lawmakers.\\n\\nHer message got a boost ahead of the speech with introductions from Democratic New York state Sen. Alessandra Biaggi and Working Families Party national director Maurice Mitchell, whose group had endorsed Warren earlier in the day.\\n\\nIn a rare round of prepared remarks, Warren channeled the women-led organizing that followed the Triangle Shirtwaist fire -- a story, she said, \"about power,\" its abuses and organized opposition -- to make a modern case for undertaking radical anti-corruption measures in Washington.\\n\\n\"Climate change. Gun safety. Health care. On the face of it, these three are totally different issues. But despite our being the strongest and wealthiest country in the history of the world, our democracy is paralyzed,\" Warren said. \"And why? Because giant corporations have bought off our government.\"\\n\\nThe measures she unveiled earlier Monday, Warren argued, would go a long way in breaking that grip. She proposed banning federal lawmakers and their senior staff from serving on corporate boards and requiring every new member of Congress to make public any potential financial conflicts before they take office. Corporate lobbyists would have to wait six years before becoming eligible for government jobs, and a range of other powerful officials -- from the president to federal judges and Cabinet secretaries -- would be permanently disqualified from working as lobbyists after leaving office.\\n\\nWarren\\'s remarks in New York were the first she\\'s delivered off a teleprompter since her campaign kickoff in Lawrence, Massachusetts, earlier this year. They also picked up a similar theme: an urgent call to action using the story of activism driven by women, in that case the \"Bread and Roses\" textile workers\\' strike of 1912.\\n\\n\"We\\'re not here today because of famous arches or famous men. In fact, we\\'re not here because of men at all,\" Warren said Monday. \"We\\'re here because of some hardworking women,\" she added, before telling, in vivid detail, the story of the Triangle Shirtwaist disaster.\\n\\nThis latest round of proposals builds on an already extensive set of suggested overhauls to how the government regulates big corporations and itself. In both the new rollout and her speech, Warren argues that without tightening anti-corruption laws and tying down big money interests, the policies favored by most progressives are doomed to defeat in Washington.\\n\\nTo untie that knot, she would impose a slate of new rules designed to \"end lobbying as we know it\" by creating a broader definition of the kinds of activities that would fall under the title. And in a specific reference to the work done by 2016 Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort, Warren proposes banning private lobbying on behalf of foreign governments.\\n\\nHer plan calls for limiting lobbyists\\' influence on domestic elections by forbidding them from making political contributions, acting as \"bundlers\" -- or helping to pool other people\\'s donations -- and hosting fundraisers for candidates. The industry more generally would also be governed by new regulations on the amount it can spend to influence elected officials, and be forced to pay a tax on annual expenditures over $500,000.\\n\\n\"Allowing individuals who are paid to influence government officials on policy to also give gifts or funnel money to the political campaigns of those same officials sounds like legalized bribery,\" Warren wrote in a Medium post.\\n\\nOn the government side, she wants to establish a federal \"Office of the Public Advocate,\" which she said in her post would engage the public in a more substantial way when regulatory rules are being negotiated or become subject to change.\\n\\nAdditionally, Warren is pushing for new mechanisms to enforce ethics rules -- and punish violations -- by creating what she\\'s calling the \"US Office of Public Integrity,\" which would be empowered to investigate potential ethical breaches by government officials.\\n\\nIn her Medium post, she connected the need for more robust enforcement back to the Trump White House\\'s habit of ignoring watchdog warnings and recommendations.\\n\\n\"When Secretary Ben Carson was warned about his son participating in fancy government events, he brushed it off,\" Warren writes. \"And when an independent federal ethics watchdog determined that Kellyanne Conway should be fired for repeatedly violating federal law, the administration barely cared.\"\\n\\nIn her speech, Warren described their boss, President Donald Trump, as \"corruption in the flesh.\" In her post, she also took aim at another Trump: retired federal appellate Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, whose departure from the bench ended an investigation into whether she had broken judicial conduct rules by committing tax fraud.\\n\\n\"Under my plan,\" Warren wrote, \"investigations will remain open until their findings are made public and any penalties for misconduct are issued.\"\\n\\nThis latest Warren plan, one of her most in-depth to date, would also seek to change the definition of what constitutes an \"official act\" when it comes to law enforcement dealings with potential or suspected pay-to-play schemes.\\n\\nWarren called the Supreme Court ruling in McDonnell v. United States -- which overturned the conviction of Republican former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell on corruption charges -- \"wrong-headed,\" and pledged to seek legislation sharpening the rules. The precedent set by the decision has made it more difficult for prosecutors to prove similar allegations in court.\\n\\nWarren\\'s proposal would again seek to impose a more comprehensive standard for what could be considered bribery of elected officials -- and eliminate what she calls a \"tractor-sized loophole\" in the law.\\n\\nThe result, she wrote, would be to ensure \"that corrupt politicians who accept bribes can be prosecuted. It also clarifies that a stream of benefits -- rather than a single act -- qualifies as an unlawful benefit paid in exchange for a bribe.\"',\n",

       "  'authors': ['Marshall Cohen'],\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump\\'s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski antagonized Democrats and stonewalled their questions about obstruction of justice during the first official impeachment-related hearing on Capitol Hill in the wake of the Russia investigation.\\n\\nThe roughly six-hour House Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday was so contentious, and yielded so little information, that the panel\\'s Democratic chairman, Rep. Jerry Nadler, threatened to hold Lewandowski in contempt. Lewandowski appeared under subpoena but refused to answer dozens of key questions.\\n\\nDemocrats hoped the televised hearing would refocus public attention on former special counsel Robert Mueller\\'s investigation, which revealed evidence that Trump obstructed justice during his first year in office, Instead, the hearing rapidly deteriorated into partisan bickering as participants hurled insults in almost every direction and tangled over parliamentary procedure.\\n\\nBut between the barbs, partisan attacks and references to Lewindowski\\'s possible New Hampshire US Senate campaign , the former Trump staffer occasionally disclosed new details about his role in an incident that Mueller examined for potential obstruction. He confirmed that Trump told him to order then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to curtail the Mueller investigation so that it would only look for future election meddling -- and stop probing his 2016 campaign.\\n\\n\"Jeff and I are friends socially, and I wanted to have the opportunity to have a meal with Jeff and relay the conversation\" about limiting the Mueller probe, Lewandowski said about his attempts to convey Trump\\'s message privately to Sessions, away from his Justice Department office.\\n\\nThe Mueller report said Lewandowski didn\\'t meet Sessions and didn\\'t carry out Trump\\'s orders. But prosecutors analyzed Trump\\'s involvement and concluded there was \"substantial evidence\" that his actions met the legal threshold for obstruction of justice. Mueller declined to decide whether Trump should face charges, and sitting presidents are shielded from prosecution.\\n\\nRecent efforts by House Democrats to push forward with their own investigation of Trump\\'s potential obstruction have largely been stymied by White House claims of executive privilege, uncooperative witnesses who still support Trump and lawsuits that are bogged down in court.\\n\\nTuesday\\'s hearing offered little progress on any of those fronts and was bitterly divided from the start. Nadler, a New York Democrat, accused the White House of orchestrating \"an absolute cover-up\" by blocking some witnesses from appearing at the public session and trying to restrict Lewandowski\\'s testimony based on \"crony privilege.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Lewandowski, your behavior in this hearing room has been completely unacceptable and it is part of a pattern by a White House desperate for the American people not to hear the truth,\" Nadler said, adding that contempt proceedings against him were \"certainly under consideration.\"\\n\\nAfter the hearing, Nadler told CNN that the hearing adds more weight for impeachment, harkening back to efforts to impeach Richard Nixon (Nixon resigned before he was impeached).\\n\\n\"Article 3 of Nixon\\'s impeachment was obstruction of Congress, refusing to obey defined congressional subpoenas, pleading imaginary privilege,\" Nadler said. \"And obviously that\\'s what the President has been doing. Nixon wasn\\'t foolish to say in advance that he\\'s going to defy all congressional subpoenas ... and today we saw a witness instructed by the White House completely contemptuous of Congress who refused to answer relevant questions. Just another instance of obstruction of Congress and that\\'s what Article 3 of the Nixon impeachment was.\"\\n\\nLewandowski used his opening statement to attack Democratic members of the committee, criticize Obama-era intelligence officials for not doing enough to stop Russian meddling, and stoke conspiracies about \"Trump haters\" in the government that wanted to bring down Trump. He even took a jab at former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about her email controversy.\\n\\nTrump, who watched parts of the hearing aboard Air Force One, cheered on his former aide in a tweet , saying, \"Such a beautiful Opening Statement by Corey Lewandowski! Thank you Corey!\"\\n\\nFew new details on obstruction\\n\\nMueller investigated 10 episodes involving Trump for potential obstruction of justice, and the incident with Lewandowski was one of those episodes. In the report, prosecutors analyzed whether each incident checked the three boxes needed to typically bring an obstruction charge.\\n\\nSome of the incidents did not meet the threshold, and others were a close call. Prosecutors determined Trump\\'s actions with Lewandowski checked all three boxes for obstruction: It was a distinct \"obstructive act\" that would hamper the investigation, the action was directly linked to an ongoing criminal probe, and there was \"substantial evidence\" of Trump\\'s obstructive intent.\\n\\nLewandowski said under oath Tuesday that Mueller\\'s report was \"an accurate representation\" of his conversations with Trump in summer 2017, when Trump wanted Sessions to stop Mueller from investigating the campaign and retool the probe to focus on meddling in future elections.\\n\\nHe also confirmed that Trump dictated to him the statement that Sessions was supposed to make to the public, clearing Trump of collusion and accusing Mueller of breaking the law.\\n\\nBut when it came time for Lewandowski to deliver that message to Sessions, he instead went on vacation, telling lawmakers, \"I took my kids to the beach ... that was more of a priority.\"\\n\\n\"The President never asked me to do anything illegal,\" Lewandowski said.\\n\\nBy and large, Lewandowski refused to answer questions from Democrats. The White House had sent a letter on Monday to the committee saying that it was directing Lewandowski not to answer questions about his conversations with Trump, beyond what is in the Mueller report.\\n\\nLewandowski vehemently denied colluding with Russia, even though he was never formally accused of collusion. He criticized his onetime internal rival, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, for sharing internal polling data with a Russian associate. And he admitted that he never called the FBI after learning that a campaign adviser was in contact with Russians\\n\\nPartisan slugfest\\n\\nThe dramatic partisan split was on full display throughout the marathon hearing.\\n\\nDemocrats, who control the committee, traded insults with Lewandowski. One lawmaker said Lewandowski \"chickened out\" because he didn\\'t follow Trump\\'s questionable orders.\\n\\nDuring a brief recess, Lewandowski\\'s posted a link on Twitter to a new website that is promoting his potential Senate campaign next year in New Hampshire. One senior Democrat on the panel later called out Lewandowski for seemingly using the hearing to appeal to the GOP base.\\n\\n\"Let me remind you, Mr. Lewandowski, that this is not a Republican primary campaign,\" said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who is the chairman of the Democratic caucus. \"You are not on the campaign trail yet. This is the House Judiciary Committee. Act like you know the difference.\"\\n\\nOn the other side, Republicans hailed Lewandowski\\'s prowess as the campaign manager for Trump\\'s long-shot presidential bid. They tried to paint him as a sympathetic figure who has already given many hours of testimony to Mueller and a slate of congressional committees.\\n\\nRepublicans have spent their time mostly attacking Democrats, calling them the \"Party of Impeachment,\" in Texas Rep. John Ratcliffe\\'s words, and asking for hearings on other issues.\\n\\nRep. Jim Jordan, the firebrand Republican from Ohio, said lawmakers should investigate alleged abuses by the Justice Department and should not focus on impeachment. A growing number of Democrats publicly support impeachment, though not enough to pass a resolution.\\n\\n\"I think they hate this President more than they love their country,\" Lewandowski said of the Democrats, a comment that later drew consternation from Democratic members of the panel.\\n\\nThe committee also subpoenaed former White House aides Rick Dearborn and Rob Porter to appear Tuesday to testify about their role in the Lewandowski incident, and other matters that were mentioned in the Mueller report. They did not show up, and the White House previously claimed that both men are immune from testifying before Congress due to executive privilege.\\n\\nThe committee has objected to this rationale previously and is currently suing to force former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify after the White House made a similar claim when he was subpoenaed earlier this year. Similar proceedings could follow for Dearborn and Porter.',\n",

       "  'authors': ['Kevin Liptak'],\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is confronting another crisis in the Middle East this week without a permanent national security adviser -- a role he hopes to fill with someone who shares his foreign policy views at a moment they appear newly muddled.\\n\\nSince firing John Bolton by tweet a week ago, Trump has interviewed or spoken with several candidates for the job, according to officials familiar with the matter. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Tuesday, the President named five of them.\\n\\nThey include a former deputy national security adviser who is well-liked inside the Pentagon; the hostage negotiator Trump personally dispatched to help free a US rapper from Swedish prison; the top foreign policy aide to the vice president; the Energy Department\\'s top nuclear official; and a well-known former government official who appears frequently on cable news.\\n\\nThe President hasn\\'t made a final decision, and later his press secretary said there were some names the President did not list who are under consideration.\\n\\nThe job opening provides Trump an opportunity to name someone more likeminded, but a crisis over Saudi oil fields that were brazenly attacked this weekend lays bare his dueling instincts in the region, inclinations that ended Bolton\\'s tenure and are bound to complicate his replacement\\'s.\\n\\nFollowing the attacks, Trump huddled at the White House on Sunday and Monday with his national security team, including the Bolton deputy, who is now filling the adviser role in an acting capacity. Other senior officials have also taken a lead in coordinating a US response to the attacks, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is expected to travel to Saudi Arabia this week at Trump\\'s behest.\\n\\nIn the sessions, officials presented Trump with his military and nonmilitary options, including new sanctions, according to an administration official. In mulling his options for responding, Trump finds himself drawn in opposing directions. While he has long sought to appear strong on Iran, he has promised voters he won\\'t be drawn into another Middle East war and says he\\'s open to talking.\\n\\nSome of those in this week\\'s meetings have included potential successors to Bolton, an Iran hawk who departed partly over disagreements on the issue. In his interviews and in interactions over the past days, Trump has sought to gauge whether those vying for the post agree with his overarching view that the United States should limit its activities abroad, according to people familiar with the matter.\\n\\nSeeking input\\n\\nTrump has solicited recommendations on the selection from advisers and friends, but officials said he would likely rely principally on advice from Pompeo , whose stature in the administration has increased. Trump said last week that he\\'d asked his chief diplomat if he was interested in also taking on the national security adviser job but that he had declined.\\n\\nTrump could look to choose someone with a lower profile than Bolton, who was a television commentator before the President hired him, according to one source familiar with the process, who cited Trump\\'s tendency to overcompensate in reaction to events like Bolton\\'s ouster. In that scenario, the job would appear more like a traditional staffer.\\n\\nWhile Trump said in his tweet dismissing Bolton that he\\'d name a new national security adviser this week, White House officials have been more circumspect in the timing of an announcement. It\\'s not clear whether a new adviser will be in place when Trump travels next week to the United Nations General Assembly or for a state visit on Friday by Australia\\'s prime minister.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not sure when he\\'s going to name that person,\" spokesman Hogan Gidley told CNN at the White House on Tuesday. \"There are a lot of folks who want that position, he\\'s been in talks with many of those people. He wants to make this a really strong pick to protect the American people but also to carry out his policies, and that was something that wasn\\'t happening.\"\\n\\nSome lawmakers have already expressed concern that Trump is confronting increased tensions in the Middle East without a national security adviser or the seasoned military officials who once populated his Cabinet.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not encouraged because, frankly, some of the people I wish were there -- I wish Jim Mattis was in the room right now, I wish H.R.

       "  'text': \"Washington (CNN) The Environmental Protection Agency is preparing to revoke California's authority to set its own vehicle emission standards, a source familiar with the plans told CNN on Tuesday, the latest move in the Trump administration's ongoing fight with the Golden State and attempts to chip away at former President Barack Obama's environmental legacy.\\n\\nThe source said the change could come as soon as Wednesday. It's yet another escalation in the clash between California and Trump administration. Industry watchers feared that the Trump administration's plan to freeze federal emission standards, a rollback of tightened standards created by the Obama administration, could have led to two auto markets in the US -- one subject to more restrictive California regulations and another linked to significantly less stringent federal standards.\\n\\nThe Trump administration has also made unraveling Obama's environmental legacy a priority. Months after he arrived in office, President Donald Trump announced the US would leave the Paris Climate Agreement and in June he revoked the Clean Power Plan, the key regulation underpinning the US' pledge in the landmark 2015 international agreement. The administration also recently revoked Obama's Waters of the United States rule and has made number of other moves that would allow for increased oil and gas production on public lands.\\n\\nThe source said the Trump administration will find the EPA previously acted unlawfully by granting the state a waiver from the Clean Air Act and allowing it to develop stricter standards than those of the federal government. About a dozen states have adopted California's standards, which are geared toward the larger goal of curbing greenhouse gases.\\n\\nCalifornia has historically been allowed to have stricter emission standards due to the state's unique geography and history of intense air pollution, highlighted by the thick smog that once blanketed Southern California. Revoking the Golden State's ability to set its own standards could stymie the downward trend in California's air pollution.\\n\\nRead More\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton said Tuesday she has spoken with many of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates and warned them about voter suppression and hacking, which she has blamed for her 2016 election loss to Donald Trump.\\n\\nClinton has previously cited those factors -- and others, especially then-FBI Director James Comey\\'s decision in late October 2016 to send a letter to Congress about her email controversy -- as reasons for her defeat, but Tuesday\\'s speech at George Washington University indicates she is hoping to pass some of those lessons onto 2020 hopefuls.\\n\\n\"You can run the best campaign. You can have the best plans. You can get the nomination. You can win the popular vote. And you can lose the Electoral College and therefore the election,\" said Clinton, who beat Trump in the popular vote by nearly 3 million ballots. She specifically pointed to Stacey Abrams\\' loss in last year\\'s Georgia gubernatorial election -- in which her opponent, Brian Kemp, was accused of suppressing minority votes, which he denied -- and referenced Republican-led efforts to pass restrictive voting measures ostensibly intended to prevent voter fraud.\\n\\nIn the weeks leading up to the 2016 election, WikiLeaks began releasing emails stolen from the personal account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, who was spammed with a link that appeared to come from Google as a security notification but led Podesta to a GRU-created website. WikiLeaks got the emails from Russian hackers\\n\\nClinton indirectly referred to that effort as she discussed on Tuesday her warnings to Democrats.\\n\\n\"I tell every candidate if you have not had your personal and campaign emails hacked, they will be,\" Clinton said. \"So will the emails of people working for you. Your information will be stolen and then weaponized against you in the most pernicious ways.\"\\n\\nShe insisted there was a need for cybersecurity that she said doesn\\'t exist in the US today and there was \"no real effort being made\" for a system that will protect voters. In April, CNN reported that Department of Homeland Security officials and senior leaders have had difficulty getting the White House to pay attention to threats of Russian election interference.\\n\\n\"Cybersecurity is an essential component of protecting our democracy but it\\'s very difficult for campaigns on their own to do that. You need a national commitment to cybersecurity,\" Clinton said.\\n\\nShe also expressed her concern for \"phony, false online news stories\" and \"lack of election security,\" saying those fighting to protect American elections \"can\\'t be deterred by ridicule or by undermining of what we know has to be done to preserve our democracy.\"\\n\\nWarner calls for Democratic anti-hacking pledge\\n\\nSpeaking at a separate event Tuesday at the Federal Election Commission about disinformation ahead of the 2020 election, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia said it was \"remarkable\" that 2020 Democratic presidential primary candidates had not all signed a common pledge against the use of malicious online tactics in campaigning.\\n\\nWarner is the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election.\\n\\nWhile some Democratic candidates have pledged not to use hacked material from foreign adversaries and not to use certain malicious online tactics, like bots and trolls, there is no partywide agreement.\\n\\nLast spring, the chairs of Democratic parties in some early-voting states called for all candidates to come to agreement on the issue.',\n",

       " {'title': 'Why race is moving center stage for 2020',\n",
       "  'authors': ['Analysis Ronald Brownstein'],\n",
       "  'text': '(CNN) An escalating cycle of action and reaction between President Donald Trump and the Democratic presidential contenders is thrusting issues of race relations and American identity to the center of the developing 2020 campaign .\\n\\nIn office, Trump has appealed even more overtly than he did as a candidate in 2016 to the racial resentments of some white voters with such comments as his call for four House Democratic women of color to \"go back\" where they came from and his 2017 declaration that \"very fine people\" had marched on both sides in Charlottesville, Virginia.\\n\\nIn response partly to Trump, and partly to demands from the party base, the 2020 Democratic presidential contenders are talking more explicitly than Hillary Clinton did in 2016 about \"systemic racism\" (Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg), \"institutional racism\" (Sen. Kamala Harris of California) and \"institutional segregation\" (former Vice President Joe Biden).\\n\\nAt last week\\'s Democratic presidential debate in Houston , former Rep. Beto O\\'Rourke of Texas echoed a recent New York Times project and declared that the introduction of slavery in 1619, not the Declaration of Independence in 1776, was the \"foundational\" event in shaping America. \"Racism in America is endemic,\" O\\'Rourke declared. \"It is foundational. We can mark the creation of this country not at the Fourth of July, 1776, but August 20, 1619, when the first kidnapped African was brought to this country against his will.\"\\n\\nSimultaneously, the eruption of new allegations of sexual assault and misconduct against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh -- and Trump\\'s emphatic immediate defense of his nominee -- is but one of several issues that are likely to highlight questions about the changing role of women in society.\\n\\nThe cumulative effect could be to compound the dynamic evident in 2016, when an array of political science studies found that attitudes about racism and sexism predicted support for Trump or Clinton much more powerfully than people\\'s assessments of their own economic situations.\\n\\nIn 2016, the studies found, the more likely voters were to say that racism and sexism are no longer problems in American life, the more likely they were to vote for Trump. Recent surveys have likewise found that Trump runs far better among voters who believe that discrimination against minorities is not a major problem than those who do; Trump supporters are also far more likely than other Americans to maintain that discrimination against whites is a significant problem, the surveys have found.\\n\\nAttitudes toward these dynamics \"is something that has divided the parties for quite awhile,\" says Brian Schaffner, a political scientist at Tufts University who conducted some of the research about the impact of attitudes toward racial and gender discrimination in 2016. \"But there\\'s something Trump has added to this ... Trump and his rhetoric just make these divisions more explicit.\"\\n\\nRhetoric is raising issues\\' profile\\n\\nIn 2020, the contrast between the nominees on issues of race relations will likely be as stark as any since the Republicans in 1964 nominated Sen. Barry Goldwater, who opposed the Civil Rights Act, against President Lyndon Johnson, who steered it into law. Trump has appealed to racial resentments more openly than any national figure in either party since George Wallace in the 1960s, while declaring that Democrats are the real racists for accusing him, and by implication his supporters, of racism.\\n\\nAt the same time, the Democratic candidates are portraying America as infected with racism more openly and insistently than any previous party leaders, even Barack Obama, the first African American president. Many of the Democrats are explicitly calling Trump a racist and some have expressed sympathy for the concept of providing reparations to African Americans for the long-term impact of slavery.\\n\\nThat means both parties are now framing the debate over America\\'s changing identity in a manner that seems likely to elevate the role of these issues in sorting voters between the two sides.\\n\\nCandidates Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Andrew Yang during the Democratic presidential debate on September 12, 2019, in Houston.\\n\\nSchaffner thinks these divisions could grow more pronounced in 2020 whether Democrats nominate a woman or racial minority to face Trump, or pick a white man.\\n\\nIf Democrats select a woman or racial minority, that candidate, like Clinton and Obama, will personify social change in a way likely to provoke the core Republican voters who are most uneasy about it, he notes. On the other hand, if Democrats nominate a white man, that candidate will likely feel pressure to respond to the party\\'s increasingly diverse electoral coalition by talking more explicitly than past nominees about \"structural\" or \"systemic\" racism.\\n\\n\"If Democrats nominate a white male, that person on one hand might seem less threatening to moderate voters who maybe have somewhat conservative racial views,\" says Schaffner. \"On the other hand, that candidate, given what the Democratic Party base looks like these days, is going to have to campaign somewhat more explicitly on issues that matter to minority groups.\"\\n\\nThat dynamic was evident in the sort of charged language that O\\'Rourke used at last week\\'s Democratic debate about slavery\\'s role in shaping American society. Major components of the Democratic coalition might consider such bracing talk long overdue, but it is also virtually certain to make \"racially conservative voters feel more resentful,\" notes Schaffner.\\n\\nAttitudes have bigger role in shaping votes\\n\\nThe heightened pressure on the Democratic field is also evident in the fierce blowback from many liberal nonwhite writers and political activists to Biden\\'s comments during last week\\'s debate about sending social workers to help low-income parents raise their children (in part by using a \"record player\" at night).\\n\\nDetailed studies of public opinion during the Trump era have almost universally concluded that there has not been significant change in the share of Americans who believe or dispute that discrimination against minorities and women is still a problem in American society. What\\'s changed under Trump is that attitudes on those questions have become more important in shaping how Americans vote.\\n\\nIn their 2018 book \"Identity Crisis,\" for instance, political scientists John Sides, Michael Tesler and Lynn Vavreck reported that multiple post-election surveys found that \"whites\\' attitudes about race, ethnicity and religion came to play a larger role in 2016 than in other recent elections.\"\\n\\nWorking with two colleagues, Schaffner likewise found that in 2016 the more likely voters were to believe that racial discrimination is not a systemic problem and that women complaining about sexism were actually seeking unfair advantage over men, the more likely they were to support Trump. That relationship was as powerful among women voters as among men, and for both groups those attitudes dwarfed voters\\' assessments of whether their personal economic situations were improving or deteriorating.\\n\\nIn a follow-up paper this year , Schaffner found that attitudes about whether racism or sexism persists as a problem predicted support for Republican or Democratic congressional candidates in 2018 more powerfully than they did in 2016 or the previous midterm election, in 2014. The reason for that greater correlation was that some previously Republican-leaning voters who are more liberal on issues relating to racial and gender discrimination peeled away from the party to support Democratic candidates last year, he found.\\n\\nAn array of recent public opinion surveys has found that a huge chasm persists between the Democratic and Republican coalitions on whether minorities still face discrimination in America.\\n\\nAn August national Quinnipiac University survey found that voters who support Trump are much more likely than those who don\\'t to believe that whites face significant discrimination in America today and African Americans and immigrants do not, according to detailed figures provided to me by the pollsters.\\n\\nIn the Quinnipiac survey, fully 57% of voters who approved of Trump\\'s job performance said that discrimination against whites was a very or somewhat serious problem today, according to those previously unpublished results. Only 34% of voters who disapproved of Trump\\'s performance agreed.\\n\\nConversely, while 94% of voters who disapprove of Trump\\'s performance say discrimination against African Americans is a problem, just 41% of those who approve of him agree. The gap is similar for immigrants: While 95% of voters who disapprove of Trump say immigrants face discrimination, just 45% of Trump supporters agree.\\n\\nPut another way, more Trump supporters say whites face discrimination (57%) than say immigrants (48%) or African Americans (41%) do. A solid majority of Trump supporters say African Americans do not face serious discrimination (55%) and a plurality say the same about immigrants (48%).\\n\\nAmong voters who don\\'t approve of Trump, the pattern is inverted: Two-thirds of them say whites don\\'t face discrimination, while only about 1 in 20 say the same about blacks or immigrants.\\n\\n2020 polling reflects the trend\\n\\nThese attitudes loom over preliminary vote choices for 2020, according to the Quinnipiac findings. In the survey, Trump held a 49% to 44% lead over Biden among the roughly two-fifths of voters who believe that discrimination against whites is a problem; Biden led Trump by 64% to 28% among the majority who said it is not.\\n\\nConversely Trump held an 81% to 13% advantage among the quarter of the electorate who say discrimination against African Americans is not a problem, while Biden led by 70% to 22% among the nearly three-fourths who say it is.\\n\\nAttitudes about gender relations divide Trump supporters and opponents in similar patterns.\\n\\nAn extensive recent study that pollster Tresa Undem conducted for the liberal women\\'s activist group Supermajority found huge gaps between liberal and conservative women not only on political choices, such as whether abortion should remain legal, but on underlying social trends, such as whether women have achieved equal treatment in American society or whether women interpret too many remarks from men as sexist.\\n\\nUndem\\'s findings reinforced the results of studies from Schaffner and his colleagues, as well as those by Erin Cassese of the University of Delaware and Tiffany Barnes of the University of Kentucky , which found that female voters who supported Trump in 2016 were far less likely than those who backed Clinton to believe that women face discrimination and far more likely to believe children are better off if their mothers stay at home and that families succeed when men work and women raise the children.\\n\\nFor many Trump supporters, \"they don\\'t see a problem\" with how women or minorities are treated, says Undem, whose firm polls mostly for nonprofit organizations and liberal advocacy groups. \"Then, they are supersensitive to being called racist and sexist,\" she continues. \"I just get the sense they have fused their own identity ... in Trump, so to attack Trump is to attack them. (They are saying,) \\'No, I\\'m not a racist, and there\\'s no racism.\\' \"\\n\\nMany polls this summer have found that a majority of Americans believe that Trump is racially insensitive and disrespectful; in the harshest possible phrasing, Quinnipiac found in July that a 51% majority of Americans consider Trump a \"racist.\"\\n\\nBut private polling conducted in recent weeks by the firm GQR for a consortium of liberal groups has stirred debate in Democratic circles by concluding that the party nonetheless is unlikely to benefit among voters by directly labeling Trump a racist. That was partly because right-leaning voters consider the phrase too loosely applied to any conservative and partly because some swing voters recoil from the level of personal acrimony inherent in the charge.\\n\\nAnna Greenberg, the Democratic pollster who conducted that research, says Democrats could find sturdier ground by accusing Trump of using race to divide the country -- rather than personally harboring racist beliefs -- and by talking about structural racial inequities.\\n\\n\"A wonky conversation about institutional racism and solutions to it I don\\'t think is threatening to most people,\" she says. The tripwire for Democrats among some white voters, she believes, is when they frame policies to expand opportunities for minorities as a kind of penance for whites. \"The difference is if you are saying, \\'This is your fault and you must pay the price of your ancestors,\\' that\\'s when I think you start getting in a little bit of trouble with voters.\"\\n\\nNavigating that line isn\\'t likely to be easy for the eventual Democratic nominee. That\\'s especially true because Trump routinely portrays any criticism of his behavior as an attempt to brand his preponderantly white supporters as racist. From the other direction, as the fierce blowback against Biden\\'s \"record player\" comments signal, Democrats face more pressure than ever to explicitly denounce racism and to portray it as the predominant force shaping life in America for minority groups, even if that formulation antagonizes some white voters.\\n\\nThose dynamics are two trains, gathering speed, on track for a head-on collision before November 2020.',\n",

       "  'authors': ['Analysis Chris Cillizza', 'Cnn Editor-At-Large'],\n",
       "  'text': '(CNN) \"Dancing with the Stars\" is, as the name suggests, a dance show/competition. While the winners (and losers) are determined by a vote by the public, it usually turns out that the \"star\" who is the best dancer or makes the most progress in the course of the show, wins. America, generally speaking, gets it right.\\n\\nAll of which brings us to the very curious case of Sean Spicer, the former White House press secretary who made his debut on \"DWTS\" Monday night.\\n\\nSpicer danced a salsa while wearing a very lime green and very frilly shirt and a pair of white pants. The three-judge panel didn\\'t love the performance, giving him a 12 (out of a possible 30) score. \"What were you doing there?\" one of the judges asked Spicer, according to the Daily Beast . \"It\\'s like you were being attacked by a swarm of wasps.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s not terribly surprising. After all, Spicer has zero background in dance. His professional partner on \"DWTS\" described him as starting at a \"pre-pre-school level. \" And being bad at dancing while on \"DWTS\" isn\\'t exactly a new thing. Master P, David Hasselhoff, Tom Delay and Steve Wozniak -- and many more -- were all laughably bad on the show. (Yes, I was an avid \"DWTS\" fan for many years.)\\n\\nWhat is surprising is that, within 24 hours of his first performance, Spicer himself is trying to cast his presence on the show as some sort of next front in the culture wars between coastal elites and the Make American Great Again crowd.\\n\\nIt started Monday night with this tweet from former Arkansas governor and longtime culture warrior Mike Huckabee:\\n\\n\"Wanna create an emotional meltdown in Hollyweird? Vote for @seanspicer to win \\'Dancing with the Stars\\' tonight and every night he\\'s on. @seanspicer is a good guy and a brave sport to go on DWTS. Let\\'s show him some love!\"\\n\\nThis is the sort of \"own the libs!\" stuff that Huckabee has trafficked in since Trump\\'s election. The elites look down on us regular folks so let\\'s show them a thing or two is a well-worn page in the Huckabee handbook.\\n\\nBut then on Tuesday morning, Spicer took it to a whole new universe. He retweeted Huckabee and added this:\\n\\n\"Thank you @GovMikeHuckabee Clearly the judges aren\\'t going to be with me. Let\\'s send a message to #Hollywood that those of us who stand for #Christ won\\'t be discounted. May God bless you\"\\n\\nWait, what? So the reason that the judges didn\\'t like Spicer\\'s performance was because he \"stand[s] for Christ\"? How, exactly, did he draw that conclusion?\\n\\nFollowing that logic, it\\'s safe to assume the judges are also racists because former NBA basketball player Lamar Odom, who is black, got the only score of the night lower than Spicer. Right? No?\\n\\nWhat if -- and stick with me here because this is going to get very complicated -- Spicer and Odom just aren\\'t good dancers? What if the reason Spicer got a low score had zero to do with Christ and everything to do with the fact that, as he himself has admitted, he has no formal training and isn\\'t a terribly good dancer?\\n\\nWild, right? I told you it was pretty out there!\\n\\nThe truth of the matter is that Spicer\\'s scores have nothing to do with his religious faith. (He is assuming all of the judges on \"DWTS\" -- and all of Hollwyood, I guess? -- lacks any religious belief.) He knows that.\\n\\nWhat\\'s Spicer doing then? Taking a page out of the victim strategy employed to devastating success by Donald Trump in 2016. Spicer is the victim here -- not of his poor dance moves but rather of an anti-religious conspiracy that shuns believers. The only way to beat back this march of secularism is to vote for him!\\n\\nThe logical twists and turns this line of argument requires are really something -- most notably that if \"DWTS\" was really so biased against people pf faith like Spicer, why would they invite him to be on the show in the first place?\\n\\nDon\\'t think too hard on it. Because there\\'s no \"there\" there. Spicer is pre-butting his possible removal from the show as a means to further his own commercial interests.\\n\\nIf his eventual elimination from the show means he is just not a very good dancer, that\\'s a loss for Spicer. But if his elimination is cast as the latest blow by the elites against MAGA country in an ongoing culture war, well then Spicer becomes a hero and a symbol to a certain segment of the public. And you can make a lot more money being a hero and a symbol than being just a bad dancer.',\n",

       "  'authors': ['Fredreka Schouten', 'Maeve Reston', 'Kaitlan Collins'],\n",
       "  'text': 'Los Angeles (CNN) President Donald Trump is warring with California\\'s Democratic officials over auto-emission standards and the state\\'s homeless crisis , but here at the center of the resistance to his administration he\\'s scooped up $15 million for his re-election campaign during a two-day swing through the Golden state.\\n\\nThe big haul -- divided between Trump\\'s campaign and the Republican National Committee -- underscores the enormous financial advantage the President has built over the Democratic field. It also highlights the ability of the White House incumbent to find support in pockets of the nation\\'s most populous state, even as he spars with its elected officials and celebrity residents.\\n\\n\"He\\'s President and he\\'s very popular with Republicans,\" California\\'s National Republican Committeewoman Harmeet Dhillon told CNN, a day after she accompanied Trump to a Bay Area fundraiser at the home of Sun Microsystems co-founder Scott McNealy.\\n\\nOfficials say the event brought in $3 million for Trump Victory, the President\\'s joint fundraising operation with the national party. Dhillon said 400 people attended the luncheon, and she had to turn away dozens more who were eager to see Trump.\\n\\n\"The President has millions of supporters in California,\" she said. \"There was not a single empty seat there.\"\\n\\nCalifornia cash despite clashes\\n\\nWhile that might be true, the Golden State is also among the most hostile to the President\\'s agenda at the grassroots level. His policies have brought hundreds of thousands of Californians out on to the streets to protest at the series of women\\' marches. Outrage over Trump\\'s rollback of environmental regulations and his administration\\'s deportation policies and vilification of undocumented immigrants, among other policy disagreements, has led the state to file 59 lawsuits against the federal government since Trump took office.\\n\\nThe antagonism toward Trump in California clearly has not dampened enthusiasm for his reelection campaign among Republican donors, which was underscored by his jaw-dropping $15 million haul over two days.\\n\\nThe biggest windfall of Trump\\'s California swing: the $5 million raised Tuesday night at the gated Beverly Hills home of real-estate developer Geoff Palmer, who has supported the President in the past and recently hosted Vice President Mike Pence for a fundraiser.\\n\\nMore than 900 people attended, and Trump spoke for 45 minutes, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told reporters.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Trump was expected to collect another $7 million at two events: $3 million at a breakfast at the Intercontinental Hotel in downtown Los Angeles and $4 million at a luncheon in San Diego.\\n\\nTrump\\'s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who has been informally involved in the re-election effort, tagged along for his West Coast visit.\\n\\nThe President, who filed his reelection paperwork the day he was sworn into office, is raising money at a pace unprecedented for a modern president. And his two-day haul surpasses the nearly $12 million that California\\'s home-state Sen. Kamala Harris raised during the entire April-to-June fundraising quarter in her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.\\n\\nOverall, Trump\\'s campaign committee and the outside groups supporting him have raised more than $200 million for his reelection through the end of June, according to a tally by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics -- nearly matching the $211 million raised by the entire field of Democrats jockeying to face him in 2020\\n\\nEven so, the California swing is not a record haul for Trump. In the two days after he formally kicked off his reelection bid with an Orlando rally in June, Trump and the Republican National Committee reported raising a combined $30 million\\n\\nUnder wraps\\n\\nAdvance details of the President\\'s fundraising activities were kept under tight wraps in the days leading up to his visit.\\n\\nAfter billionaire real-estate developer Stephen Ross faced serious backlash for hosting a fundraiser for the President last month in the Hamptons, an official familiar with how the fundraisers are planned said there has been an active effort underway in recent weeks to keep the names of those hosting the fundraisers out of the press.\\n\\nFew dozen protesters gathered along the route of the Bay Area fundraiser.\\n\\nDhillon also cited violent demonstrations that broke out during Trump\\'s 2016 visit to California as a candidate as a reason for the secrecy surrounding his events this week.\\n\\nTrump\\'s visit stirred controversy even before he arrived.\\n\\nThe actress Debra Messing publicly demanded a list of who would attend Trump\\'s fundraiser in Beverly Hills. Trump slammed Messing in response, calling the \"Will & Grace\" star a \"bad\" actress who was seeking to \"blacklist\" his supporters.\\n\\nDhillon said the Bay Area event could have attracted three times the number of donors who crowded into McNealy\\'s Portola Valley mansion on Tuesday to hear the President.\\n\\nTrump and his team \"left a lot of money on the table\" during their short visit.\\n\\n\"I asked them \\'Will you come back?\" Dhillon added. \"They said, \\'Absolutely. \\' \"\\n\\nCalifornia\\'s GOP\\n\\nFor decades now, Republicans in California have been receding into the political wilderness , but Trump appears to be accelerating that decline. There is no Republican official elected statewide in California, and the GOP\\'s last grip on power was the number of seats they held in Congress. But that grip was weakened in the 2018 midterm elections. Trump\\'s policies brought out outraged Democratic voters -- particularly women -- in droves and they succeeded in flipping more than a half-dozen seats from red to blue.\\n\\nThe number of registered independents in California (28.3%) has also been rising. Democrats, who make up 43% of the electorate, vastly outnumber Republicans here (23.6%), according to data from the Public Policy Institute of California . The institute has found that more Californians favor Trump\\'s impeachment than the nation as a whole, and 65% of voters said they would choose a candidate other than the President in the election next year.\\n\\nStill, Trump -- whose approval rating has hovered around 40% nationally -- enjoys strong support from Republicans here: 84% of GOP voters approve of the job that Trump has done as President, while 43% of independents and 8% of Democrats approve, according to the latest PPIC survey.\\n\\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom has relished the fight against Trump\\'s agenda, stating that California is the \"progressive answer to a transgressive president.\"\\n\\nThe two tangled this week over the Trump administration\\'s decision to revoke California\\'s waiver with the Environmental Protection Agency, which allowed the state to set more stringent vehicle emissions standards than those set at the federal level. California had been so successful in negotiating with auto makers in their efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions and address air quality issues that 13 states and the District of Columbia follow at least some portion of their Advanced Clean Car Program.\\n\\n\"One thing I won\\'t do is capitulate,\" Newsom told CNN\\'s Kyung Lah in an interview about his contentious relationship with the commander-in-chief before Trump formally announced that his administration would revoke the vehicle emissions waiver.\\n\\n\"Look stay out of our way, let California continue, not to survive, but thrive, despite the headwinds, despite everything you\\'re doing to try to put sand in the gears of our success.\"\\n\\nTrump ended his trip with a final shot at California as he flew back to Washington aboard Air Force One, announcing his intention to give San Francisco a notice of environmental violations due to its homelessness problem.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a terrible situation -- that\\'s in Los Angeles and in San Francisco,\" he said to reporters, according to a report from a pool reporter. \"And we\\'re going to be giving San Francisco -- they\\'re in total violation -- we\\'re going to be giving them a notice very soon.\"\\n\\n\"EPA is going to be putting out a notice,\" he added. \"They\\'re in serious violation.\"',\n",

       "  'authors': ['Manu Raju', 'Dana Bash'],\n",
       "  'text': '(CNN) Tensions are building within the House Democratic Caucus over the Judiciary Committee\\'s march toward impeachment , with Democrats again at odds over their messaging and strategy during a crucial time facing their majority.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of Corey Lewandowski\\'s testimony this week , some Democrats are openly questioning the wisdom of bringing forward the bombastic former Trump campaign manager, whose contentious exchanges with Democrats and stonewalling of their questions may have overshadowed a key aspect of his testimony: that President Donald Trump enlisted Lewandowski to tell the then-attorney general to limit the investigation into his 2016 campaign.\\n\\nWhat has irked some Democrats is the failure to hold Lewandowski in contempt immediately during the hearing, according to Democratic sources. That may soon change as the committee weighs holding him in contempt, source says.\\n\\nConversations about the wisdom of bringing Lewandowski in to testify played out behind closed doors between Democratic leadership aides and committee staff in the run-up to Tuesday\\'s hearing, sources told CNN. And on Wednesday, some Democrats openly questioned the need for the hearing.\\n\\n\"If I\\'m sitting at home, as a person who\\'s struggling to pay for my insulin, I\\'m saying to myself, \\'What the heck is going on in Washington?\\' \" said Rep. Anthony Brindisi, a freshman Democrat from New York whose seat the GOP is targeting in 2020, when asked about the hearing. \"It seems like nothing is getting done. Democrats and Republicans continue to fight. It\\'s a sideshow.\"\\n\\nRep. Maxine Waters, an outspoken supporter of impeachment, said that while she believed that Lewandowski was \"nailed\" when he confirmed that he had been directed by Trump to urge then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to limit the probe into his campaign, she also said the committee should have brought forward another witness first as it opened its new round of impeachment hearings.\\n\\n\"I think that there are some others who should have come first,\" the California Democrat told CNN. \"I didn\\'t think that he was necessarily the best one, but since he was there I think that what came out of it was his attitude, something about his character and the way that he disrespected the committee.\"\\n\\nDemocratic leadership staff warned of spectacle\\n\\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, who has thrown cold water on moving forward on impeachment, told CNN on Wednesday that he had not seen the Lewandowski hearing so he didn\\'t want to comment, but added: \"Most people think it was sort of disruptive.\"\\n\\nAsked if Democrats could be clearer in their messaging about their impeachment deliberations, the Maryland Democrat added: \"I think it could be clearer, but always the message could be clearer. But I think the message is pretty clear. The Judiciary Committee is doing what it\\'s constitutionally supposed to do.\"\\n\\nPrivately for weeks, Democrats recognized that the Lewandowski hearing could indeed turn into a sideshow. But the committee, facing the White House\\'s blockade of key witnesses, faced a dilemma: Bring in Lewandowski and get rare testimony from a fact-witness of potential obstruction of justice -- but risk a circus-like atmosphere.\\n\\nIn the days leading up to the Lewandowski hearing, Democratic leadership staff warned Judiciary committee aides that it would be a spectacle that could get out of control, according to a senior Democratic source familiar with the conversation.\\n\\nA committee source insisted that Democratic leadership staff and the Judiciary Committee had for months been carefully coordinating their plan for hearings, including bringing in nongovernment individuals like Lewandowski who would be unable to defy a congressional subpoena.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spokeswoman Ashley Etienne said: \"We supported Judiciary\\'s hearing with Lewandowski because he was Trump\\'s top henchman in his effort to shut down the Mueller investigation,\" saying the hearing \"clearly demonstrated\" the President had acted illegally.\\n\\nOthers acknowledge it was a messy hearing but argued it was successful.\\n\\n\"Look, these are going to be contentious hearings,\" said Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, a Judiciary Committee Democrat who favors impeachment proceedings. \"These are people who are part of an elaborate cover-up in an effort to obstruct Congress from getting to the truth. And this is going to be a rocky road. If people think people are just going to come forward and sort of admit all the elements of the crime and go home, that\\'s not the way these things work.\"\\n\\nRep. Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat who\\'s the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, acknowledged the theatrics at the hearing \"never help,\" saying on Wednesday: \"It is intended to obscure.\"\\n\\nBut he also told CNN that Lewandowski\\'s refusal to answer questions adds weight to the committee\\'s push toward impeachment, citing article three of the Nixon impeachment resolution alleging he had obstructed Congress.\\n\\n\"We saw a witness instructed by the White House completely contemptuous of Congress who refused to answer relevant questions,\" Nadler said. \"Just another instance of obstruction of Congress, and that\\'s what article 3 of the Nixon impeachment was.\"\\n\\nFrustration behind the scenes\\n\\nBut how Democrats are messaging their investigation remains a sore spot among many in the caucus. Nadler has been increasingly vocal in recent weeks that his panel is conducting an inquiry to determine whether to impeach the President, language that Pelosi has yet to embrace.\\n\\nAt a private meeting about two weeks ago, Pelosi expressed annoyance at House Judiciary staff for pushing ahead on impeachment and going further than many members of her caucus, according to several sources. Some Judiciary aides, she said, just want to impeach.\\n\\n\"Feel free to leak this,\" the California Democrat said, according to several sources in the room, a comment first reported by Politico\\n\\nAt that same meeting, though, she also expressed support for Nadler\\'s handling of the investigation and said she backed the moves he was making in court, the sources said. She didn\\'t rule out impeachment in those remarks.\\n\\nPelosi was among those who were frustrated by Lewandowski\\'s behavior in Tuesday\\'s hearing. In a meeting on Wednesday, a Democratic lawmaker commented on the level of disrespect that Lewandowski had displayed at the hearing for the committee and Congress\\' authority to uncover the truth. Pelosi agreed that his behavior was beyond the pale and contemptible, and went on to say that he could have been held in contempt right then and there. However, her comment was a critique of Lewandowski\\'s behavior, not the handling of the hearings.\\n\\nIn public, Pelosi has greenlit the Judiciary Committee\\'s language in lawsuits -- seeking the underlying grand jury material in the probe by special counsel Robert Mueller and testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn -- that says explicitly the committee is actively considering whether to move to impeach the President.\\n\\nSome Democrats believe Pelosi is intentionally seeking to muddy the messaging in order to make it harder to impeach the President, something the speaker has said could help Trump\\'s reelection in 2020, while others believe she\\'s giving herself flexibility to please both sides of the caucus.\\n\\n\"It\\'s all strategic,\" said one House Democrat who is frustrated with Pelosi over the issue.\\n\\nThe most important thing to Pelosi\\n\\nAt a closed-door caucus meeting on Wednesday, Pelosi told her caucus that the most important thing is winning in 2020 and beating Trump, per three sources. While she didn\\'t rule out impeachment, lawmakers left with the impression that she wants Democrats to tread carefully with impeachment because she thinks it could ultimately help Trump.\\n\\nTo help keep the majority, Democrats need to hold seats like that of Brindisi, who said he has spoken directly with Pelosi and Nadler in recent days about his concerns over moving forward with impeachment.\\n\\n\"I talked to her a lot last week or so about it, and I walked away with a positive impression of where she stands on this,\" Brindisi said. \"I think that she wants to see where the American people are, and I think she recognizes that the American people aren\\'t there on impeachment right now, and we have to focus on areas where they are supportive, like lowering drug costs.\"\\n\\nBut other Democrats say the reason why their party won a House majority was not only on issues like health care but also on promises of holding Trump accountable.\\n\\n\"I think ultimately we will move forward,\" said Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat who\\'s a member of the House Intelligence Committee.\\n\\nOthers say the combativeness of witnesses should not deter the impeachment investigation from moving ahead.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not going to be pretty if they come and act like that, but they\\'re not going to be rewarded by just being s***-disturbers,\" said Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat who sits on both the House Intelligence and Judiciary panels. \"If they think that they can act that way and we\\'re just going to say, \\'You know what, we\\'re not going to have any more hearings because it was a mess,\\' that\\'s not -- we\\'re not going to reward that behavior.\"\\n\\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.',\n",

But on the divisive topic of firearm regulation, Congress has repeatedly failed to enact stricter gun control in the aftermath of shootings, despite calls for action.\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated that he doesn\\'t plan to bring up any legislation in the Senate unless it is clear that the President would sign off on it -- and it\\'s not yet clear what exactly the President would support.\\n\\nWhite House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said in a statement on Wednesday, \"The President has not signed off on anything yet but has been clear he wants meaningful solutions that actually protect the American people and could potentially prevent these tragedies from ever happening again.\"\\n\\nAttorney General William Barr was on the Hill for the second day in a row, meeting this afternoon with lawmakers alongside the top legislative affairs aides at the Justice Department and the White House, a Justice Department official told CNN.\\n\\nAccording to a copy obtained by CNN, the document circulating on the Hill describing the proposal states that \"a background check requirement would be extended to all advertised commercial sales, including sales at gun shows,\" and that it would follow in the mold of background check legislation introduced by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia in 2013.\\n\\nWhite House aides have spent the last month meeting with congressional staffers and devising a legislative measures. The Department of Justice also prepared a package of options that was delivered to the White House more than two weeks ago.\\n\\nBut the White House has yet to publicly release any gun measures that it would support.\\n\\nSome of the options being proposed in discussions, in addition to measures Trump and his aides have floated publicly, include allowing minors\\' records to be included in background check databases, alerting local authorities when someone fails a background check, applying bigger penalties for straw purchases (when someone buys a gun for someone else) and helping states implement \"red flag\" laws, which would remove weapons from people deemed at risk.\\n\\nBarr has been supportive of expanded background checks in conversations with the White House, CNN has reported. The gun package has become a top issue for the attorney general, who has explored the policy questions in a number of meetings at the Justice Department with senior law enforcement officials, including from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Justice Department official said.\\n\\nRepublican lawmakers react to background check proposal\\n\\nWhen asked if he thinks the Barr proposal has a future in the Senate, McConnell told CNN, \"As I\\'ve said repeatedly, we are still waiting a proposal from the White House and I know they are considering everything. And since he\\'s part of the administration, I\\'m sure what he\\'s talking about is part of their consideration.\"\\n\\nIn one indication that it may be difficult to win a critical mass of Republican support, the National Rifle Association said in a statement that it opposes the document being circulated on the Hill.\\n\\nJason Ouimet, executive director of the NRA\\'s Institute for Legislative Action, said in a statement, \"This missive is a non-starter with the NRA and our 5 million members because it burdens law-abiding gun owners while ignoring what actually matters: fixing the broken mental health system and the prosecution of violent criminals.\"\\n\\nThe proposal met with praise and skepticism in a Senate Republican closed-door policy lunch Wednesday, according to participants who said they held a lengthy discussion about all the latest gun proposals to see if they could unify around any of them.\\n\\n\"It was a family discussion,\" said Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, who insisted it wasn\\'t heated but \"very respectful.\"\\n\\nLeaving the lunch, most senators avoided reporters\\' questions about the proposal by saying that they had not had time to study it closely.\\n\\nBut Cramer, a conservative, said the proposal is \"most closely aligned\" with the plan from Manchin and Toomey that would expand background checks to all commercial sales.\\n\\nCramer described Manchin-Toomey as \"probably the furthest out from the Republican dogma\" and something his constituents consider to be a \"slippery slope and probably something that is not helpful.\"\\n\\nThe comparison to Manchin-Toomey could spell trouble for the latest proposal because that bill wasn\\'t able to pass the Democratic-controlled chamber in 2013 and is opposed by most Republicans.\\n\\nAs he headed into the lunch, Toomey said he had spoken to Barr about the proposal and that the attorney general has \"some very constructive ideas. Creative and thoughtful. In all likelihood, I would be very supportive. There are some details we need to flush out.\"\\n\\nRepublican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, refused to embrace the proposal, saying the Senate should instead pass a proposal from him and GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa that aims to tackle the mental health component of the mass shootings crisis and beef up prosecutions of gun crimes.\\n\\n\"I believe that the proper path for the Senate to take is to vote on Grassley-Cruz and pass it,\" he said.\\n\\nCruz said the entire debate had been poisoned by Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\\'Rourke\\'s pronouncement at the last debate that if he were president he would want to confiscate weapons.\\n\\nSen. John Kennedy, a Republican of Louisiana, who said he has a meeting later in the day with Barr, insisted the proposal \"hasn\\'t gelled yet.\"\\n\\n\"I think this is still a very fluid process. I could be wrong but I doubt it,\" he said. \"I don\\'t think the White House has definitely decided on a way forward and we\\'re talking about it.\"\\n\\nSen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, said the White House and Senate Republicans are giving \"a great deal of thought\" to the various \"proposals that are meaningful and would make a difference.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s why it\\'s taking some time,\" he said.\\n\\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.',\n",

       "  'authors': ['Analysis Brandon Tensley'],\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington (CNN) When Americans talk about guns, what\\'s arguably most interesting isn\\'t what we say about the devices themselves. It\\'s what we betray about whose voices -- and lives -- matter when it comes to our country\\'s virulent gun culture.\\n\\nIndeed, the heartbreaking permanence of the school shooting reality is undeniable when watching Sandy Hook Promise\\'s wrenching new back-to-school PSA , which forces viewers to come to grips with present-day America for school children.\\n\\nThe heightened concern over mass shootings in schools is something Dave Chappelle satirizes in his controversial new Netflix stand-up special that highlights a harsh truth about America\\'s relationship with gun control.\\n\\nOne of its few moments of insight arrives during the comic\\'s discussion of gun violence. In particular, he subtly gets at a key trend: how much the messaging on gun regulation, on the whole, has changed in recent decades.\\n\\n\"Shooting up schools is a white kid\\'s game. I hated school, too. It never occurred to me -- kill everybody in school? It\\'s f***ing crazy,\" Chappelle says.\\n\\nDecades ago, when Congress actually passed an assault weapons ban (that, notably, was allowed to expire in 2004), the broad concern was around guns in the hands of minorities -- black Americans, specifically. Our modern Congress finds itself paralyzed now that we\\'re increasingly facing a different dimension of the issue: white people\\'s guns and the consequences of their contested rights to have them.\\n\\nUnderstanding this shift requires looking back at the social and political pieties that helped to spur America\\'s contemporary gun-rights movement. Consider how fear of the Black Panthers motivated conservative politicians -- even the National Rifle Association -- to push for stricter gun control in the 1960s. The Panthers, frustrated by the country\\'s repeated failure to protect its black citizens, advocated for black self-defense via gun ownership and \"copwatching.\"\\n\\nTo no one\\'s surprise, the backlash against this vision of protection was swift. In 1967, in response to the Panthers\\' activities, then-Gov. Ronald Reagan signed the Mulford Act, named after Republican Assemblyman Don Mulford and which repealed a California law that permitted people to carry loaded firearms in public.\\n\\nOf the bill, Reagan said later that it\\'d \"work no hardship on the honest citizen.\" (This citizen, we can assume, was white.)\\n\\nCrucially, while unthinkable today, the NRA\\'s position on gun regulation until the late \\'70s -- when more and more (white) people began viewing guns as a means of protecting themselves and their status -- was noticeably divorced from Second Amendment arguments, as Adam Winkler, a professor at the UCLA School of Law, charts\\n\\nHow distant all that seems now.\\n\\nThese days, despite a bit of a resurgence in black gun ownership , the face of the gun-rights advocate has changed -- rural white conservatives are now among the most vocal proponents.\\n\\nTake, for instance, Missouri, where, in the past two decades, \"an increasingly conservative and pro-gun legislature and citizenry had relaxed limitations governing practically every aspect of buying, owning, and carrying firearms in the state,\" writes Jonathan M. Metzl, a professor of sociology and psychiatry at Vanderbilt University, in his new book, \"Dying of Whiteness: How the Politics of Racial Resentment Is Killing America\\'s Heartland.\"\\n\\nCompare this to the rhetoric of the \\'90s, when, in signing what became the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (which contained the aforementioned Federal Assault Weapons Ban), former President Bill Clinton said , \"Gangs and drugs have taken over our streets and undermined our schools.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s the difference between vanquishing the specter of black criminality -- seen in gangs and the weapons associated with them -- and protecting the property of white conservatives.\\n\\nOr put another way, the hypocrisy around gun ownership in America is a broadcast of something indisputably fundamental: the country\\'s struggle to bolster a racial hierarchy.\\n\\nThere was a nod to this knotty history at the Democratic debate in September, when Cory Booker, New Jersey\\'s junior senator and a presidential candidate, mentioned how even though gun violence had long afflicted areas of the state, it was often ignored until it crept into other, presumably whiter neighborhoods.\\n\\n\"We\\'re never going to solve this crisis if we have to wait for it to personally affect us or our neighborhood or our community before we demand action,\" Booker said.\\n\\nIn Washington, it\\'s still an open question as to whether lawmakers will make any headway on the issue, given the White House\\'s waffling on proposals such as expanding background checks.\\n\\nChappelle\\'s solution, though?\\n\\n\"Every able-bodied African American must register for a legal firearm. That\\'s the only way they\\'ll change the law,\" he says.\\n\\nChappelle may be (half-)kidding, but in his gag is also a history that reveals more about the politics of gun regulation in America than the words of most politicians.',\n",

In some instances, officials will brief the President in person before he is connected to another leader.\\n\\nTrump\\'s preference is often to conduct calls by himself from the Executive Residence, a desire that has at times forced key national security aides to monitor the conversations from other parts of the White House complex, including the Situation Room, far away from the President himself.\\n\\nThat posed a problem, the official said, as aides often want to be in the room to guide the President through complicated issues while the call is ongoing. But as leaks from the calls over the course of the administration angered Trump, top officials in the West Wing began to limit who could listen in on the conversations, hoping to tighten the circle of people aware of what the President was discussing with foreign leaders.\\n\\nOutlandish requests\\n\\nWorld leaders frequently approach Trump with impossible or obscure requests, be it asking for support for a certain policy or appealing for the United States\\' help on certain matters, according to an administration official.\\n\\nOften, Trump will respond by telling his counterpart he\\'ll have \"his people look into it\" -- a brush-off the administration official said was the President\\'s way of casting aside unfeasible requests.\\n\\nIn one such instance, a foreign leader asked the President to intervene when a state-owned entity came under Justice Department indictment. The President said it would be looked into, though nothing ultimately was done.\\n\\nTwo officials said Trump is more cautious in his phone conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, careful not to make requests or commitments that could later be used against him. Trump\\'s relationship with Putin has been highly scrutinized after US intelligence agencies blamed Putin for ordering an election interference campaign in 2016 to benefit Trump.\\n\\nTrump has questioned that intelligence, and broke with his aides advice in 2018 to congratulate Putin in a phone call after an election win widely seen as illegitimate.\\n\\nThe two men\\'s interactions have at times alarmed national security officials, including when they met privately without aides or note-takers. Trump also alarmed US intelligence officials when he discussed classified information with Russian officials in the Oval Office.\\n\\nBut aides said Trump has been careful in other phone calls with Putin to avoid being pinned down, though did offer US assistance at the end of July for wildfires in Siberia.\\n\\nUnder scrutiny\\n\\nThat phone call, along with a half-dozen other conversations, have now come under scrutiny amid the controversy surrounding the intelligence whistleblower. Little is known about the conversation in question, but in the weeks leading up to the August 12 complaint, Trump spoke by phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, French President Emmanuel Macron, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in addition to Putin.\\n\\nDuring a call between the President and a foreign leader, only around four officials are typically listening, including the national security adviser, the National Security Council director and deputy director for that region.\\n\\nThe calls occur on a recorded secure line and are listened to in the Situation Room, people familiar with the process said. A transcript of the call is then filed away and very few people in the White House or wider administration have access to it.\\n\\nChanging protocols\\n\\nLast April, CNN was first to report that the White House had suspended the practice of publishing public summaries of Trump\\'s phone calls with foreign leaders, though sources said \"readouts\" continued to be released internally.\\n\\nWhile the White House did not release public descriptions of the phone calls, press aides would confirm that the calls took place only after they were reported by foreign governments, though rarely elaborated on what was said.\\n\\nBut that suspension has shifted in recent months. The White House has started releasing public readouts of the President\\'s formal calls with leaders once again, including several of those now under scrutiny. The readouts are handled at the National Security Council, but approved by the West Wing press office before being released. They are often brief, with few details.\\n\\nA National Security Council spokesman declined to immediately elaborate on why the policy changed. It has been in effect for at least the last full month.\\n\\nStill, two people familiar with the matter cautioned that there are not readouts for every call the President makes -- there are only official readouts for the official calls.\\n\\nTrump, who has multiple iPhones that aides once joked were \"Trump 1\" and \"Trump 2,\" has developed a habit in office of calling foreign leaders that he\\'s developed a personal relationship with, often after hours when most of his staff is not in the office.\\n\\nHe\\'s also distributed his cell phone numbers to at least two foreign leaders, telling them to call him personally. It\\'s not clear how often, if at all, those leaders used Trump\\'s personal line.',\n",

       "  'authors': ['Manu Raju', 'Zachary Cohen'],\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington (CNN) The intelligence community inspector general suggested to the House Intelligence Committee Thursday that the controversial whistleblower complaint , which is at the center of a dispute between the director of national intelligence and Congress, raised concerns about multiple actions but would not say if those instances involved President Donald Trump, sources familiar with the closed-door briefing told CNN.\\n\\nOne source said that Inspector General Michael Atkinson referenced \"a sequence of events\" and \"alleged actions\" that took place. However, another source disputed that the IG provided substantive details regarding the whistleblower claim. The whistleblower\\'s complaint deals at least in part with Ukraine, The New York Times and Washington Post reported Thursday night.\\n\\nCNN had earlier reported, citing a source familiar with the case, that the complaint was prompted by concerns over communications between the President and a foreign leader. The alleged whistleblower didn\\'t have direct knowledge of the communications that partly prompted the complaint to the inspector general, an official briefed on the matter told CNN on Thursday. Instead, the whistleblower\\'s concerns came in part from learning information that was not obtained during the course of their work, and those details have played a role in the administration\\'s determination that the complaint didn\\'t fit the reporting requirements under the intelligence whistleblower law, the official said.\\n\\nThe whistleblower\\'s attorney, Andrew Bakaj, had no comment when asked about the claim that the individual did not have direct knowledge of the communication in question. When asked if the complaint deals with Ukraine, Bakaj again had no comment.\\n\\nA source close to the whistleblower\\'s legal team pushed back strongly against the assertion that the intelligence Community\\'s Inspector General would accept \"third-hand disclosures\" and that what the official \"outlined about lack of personal knowledge and not within their course of work seems like the beginning of a smear by those trying to discredit the whistleblower.\"\\n\\nAtkinson was pressed for details but was mostly resistant to the queries during Thursday\\'s briefing, saying he is not allowed to provide details of the substance of the complaint because he was not authorized to do so, the sources said.\\n\\nAdam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters following the briefing that Atkinson told the committee that he was not allowed to provide details related to the substance of the complaint nor say whether the White House was involved in denying its release to Congress, because he was not authorized to do so.\\n\\nWhite House involvement\\n\\nCNN reported Thursday that the White House was involved , advising the nation\\'s top intelligence agency that the controversial complaint is outside intelligence activities covered by laws governing intelligence whistleblowers, according to three sources familiar with the matter.\\n\\nAtkinson would only discuss the process for his handling of the whistleblower\\'s concerns, Schiff said. Lawmakers pressed for details nonetheless, though their efforts ultimately went unanswered.\\n\\nThat process was sharply criticized by Democrats, including Schiff, who said that his committee may take legal action if the complaint isn\\'t turned over to Congress.\\n\\nRep. Mike Quigley, a Democrat on the committee, attacked the Justice Department and Attorney General Bill Barr for their involvement .\\n\\n\"In their mind it\\'s to protect the President. And it doesn\\'t matter if that violates the laws,\" he said.\\n\\nAsked if lawmakers were told the Justice Department intervened in the process, Quigley answered: \"The Department of Justice Opinions.\"\\n\\nQuigley also added that \"there\\'s a lot more we have to learn.\"\\n\\nThe briefing was described in advance by Schiff as focusing on the \"handling\" of the complaint.\\n\\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee will also be briefed by Atkinson and acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire behind closed doors next week, a spokesperson told CNN Thursday, noting an exact date has not yet been selected.\\n\\nSenate intelligence committee chairman, Republican Sen. Richard Burr and vice chairman Sen. Mark Warner, have been has been working with both officials and Warner has been significantly less outspoken about the complaint than Schiff, but the Senate spokesperson told CNN that the two men have been engaged in a bipartisan effort to ensure the situation is resolved and that the whistleblower\\'s rights are protected, adding these cases should not be negotiated in the press.\\n\\nThe inspector general does not have the authority to discuss the details of the complaint with Congress because Maguire has not shared the actual report with the committee and has apparently not otherwise authorized Atkinson to share those details.\\n\\nThe intelligence whistleblower act does not allow for details to be provided until the actual complaint has been given to Congress, CNN legal contributor Steve Vladeck explained.\\n\\nDemocrats contend the DNI is violating the law, something the office disputes.\\n\\nInspector general did not agree with decision to withhold complaint\\n\\nA source familiar with Tuesday\\'s briefing told CNN that the inspector general indicated to lawmakers that he did not agree with the administration\\'s assertion that details in the whistleblower complaint should be withheld from Congress.\\n\\nAtkinson explained that he could not disclose the details in the complaint as the Justice Department stated it was outside the jurisdiction of DNI and therefore outside of the jurisdiction of the inspector general, the source said.\\n\\nHe also explained that \"privileges\" were being asserted by the administration, leaving lawmakers with the impression that the White House was directly involved in blocking the information from being turned over to Congress.\\n\\nAfter Tuesday\\'s briefing, the House Intelligence Committee released a new letter from Atkinson, dated September 17, saying he had determined he and the acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire were at an impasse over the issue of whether a whistleblower could contact Congressional lawmakers directly with \"appropriate security practices.\"\\n\\nThat letter was sent Schiff and Ranking Minority Devin Nunes.\\n\\nA communication between President Donald Trump and a foreign leader prompted the whistleblower complaint, a source familiar with the case told CNN.\\n\\nThe concern was first revealed by The Washington Post, which reported that an official in the American intelligence community was so bothered by a \"promise\" Trump made to a foreign leader that the official filed a formal whistleblower complaint with the inspector general of the intelligence community, citing two former US officials familiar with the matter. CNN has not independently confirmed the detail about a \"promise\" made to the foreign leader.\\n\\nThe source who spoke to CNN would not disclose the foreign leader with whom Trump was alleged to have spoken.\\n\\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment. The White House has not responded to CNN\\'s request for comment.\\n\\nThe President dismissed the reporting on Thursday morning, rhetorically asking if there is \"anybody dumb enough to believe\" it.\\n\\n\"Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem!,\" he tweeted.\\n\\n\"Knowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially \\'heavily populated\\' call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA!\" Trump said.',\n",

       "  'authors': ['Jamie Ehrlich', 'Em Steck', 'Andrew Kaczynski'],\n",
       "  'text': '(CNN) Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson once entertained 9/11 conspiracy theories on a radio show hosted by a prominent \"truther\" who claimed that the World Trade Center attacks were orchestrated by a \"Zionist organized crime outfit.\"\\n\\nIn the 2012 appearance, Williamson declined to challenge the host\\'s conspiracy theory and said that questioning the factual history of the September 11, 2001, attacks was acceptable and no different than questioning the government account of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The interview was first shared on Twitter in early August but has not been widely circulated or reported on.\\n\\nIn response to questions about this interview and other appearances with 9/11 truthers, Williamson campaign manager Patricia Ewing told CNN that \"over the course of her 35-year career as an author, activist and speaker, Williamson has been interviewed hundreds and hundreds of times by media outlets that run the gamut.\" Ewing said the appearances were \"not an endorsement of the hosts philosophy or ideas,\" adding \"she\\'s talking about her ideas, not theirs.\"\\n\\nWilliamson was a guest on Truth Jihad, a radio show hosted by conspiracy theorist Kevin Barrett. Barrett has peddled claims that Israelis were involved in orchestrating 9/11 and that Kennedy and Texas Gov. John Connally could not have been shot by the same bullet , as a US government commission concluded. Barrett has said in interviews on Iranian government-funded television that 9/11 was an \"inside job,\" a \"Zionist coup d\\'état,\" and \"another Hollywood film.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know if you knew it, but I was chased out of the academy back in 2006 for talking about, uh, the questions surrounding what really happened on September 11, 2001,\" Barrett said to Williamson on the show.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve lost two jobs, one tenure track job at the University of Wisconsin and I\\'m unemployable at the American academy right now. So, if we have a fascist country -- if that means that you can\\'t even come close to telling the truth about the most important event of the century and still have a job as a professor, or at least you\\'re risking your job -- then we\\'re pretty fascist,\" Barrett said, waiting for an answer from the future Presidential candidate.\\n\\n\"Yeah, I couldn\\'t agree with you more,\" Williamson, who is Jewish, responded. \"And I think listen, to have questions about 9/11, to me, is no different than having questions about the Warren Commission. And I don\\'t believe in the single bullet theory of the Kennedy assassination either.\"\\n\\nEwing, Williamson\\'s campaign manager, pointed to another portion of the interview where Barrett criticized American democracy saying that in comparison Iran \"actually looks pretty good.\" Williamson pushed back calling his comments \"radically against the US government\" saying that while she disagreed with him on some points she celebrated \"the freedoms\" Americans have to speak their minds.\\n\\nLater in the show, Barrett asserted that a \"Zionist organized crime outfit\" were manipulating the Republican Party. Williamson failed to challenge Barrett\\'s views on the orchestration of 9/11, but later offered some push back against Barrett\\'s \"worldview\" saying she didn\\'t want to see Israel \"obliterated.\"\\n\\n\"I think the Republicans are in the hands of the Zionist organized crime outfit that has been dedicated to going to a war with Iran ever since they blew up the Trade Towers,\" Barrett said.\\n\\nWilliamson responded: \"So you think that the Zionist organized crime unit were the ones who did 9/11?\"\\n\\nBarrett responded by mentioning Larry Silverstein, the developer of the Ground Zero site in Manhattan, who is also Jewish.\\n\\n\"Absolutely,\" Barrett said. \"Just Google Larry Silverstein.\"\\n\\n\"So wait, I need to ask. So I understand the theory of 9/11 being an artificially created Pearl Harbor in order to justify an Iraq War,\" Williamson interjected before being cut off by Barrett, who corrected her and said that 9/11 \"was about destroying the enemies of Israel.\"\\n\\n\"So, yeah, there, you know. Yeah,\" Williamson responded. \"Well, you know, the way I look at Israel, I look at Israel like I look at the United States, you know, the people of Israel are not the government of Israel.\"\\n\\nBarrett\\'s theories that falsely posit a conspiracy involving Israeli complacency in the 9/11 attacks have deeply anti-Semitic roots. Blaming Israel or Jews for manipulating world events, as the Anti- Defamation League argues, is a manifestation of an age-old trope that the Jewish people plot actions in order to gain or maintain power.\\n\\nWilliamson hasn\\'t used her presidential platform to push these discredited and highly inflammatory theories. But a KFile review of her past appearances has provided a window into past associations with conspiracy theorists. A previous KFile investigation in August found that Williamson\\'s radio show once gave a platform to the unfounded theory that vaccines are linked to autism.\\n\\nIn several instances, Williamson has appeared, promoted and been featured at conferences, podcasts and radio shows that gave a platform to 9/11 \"truthers\" who claim a secret plot behind the World Trade Center attacks. Between 2014 and 2016, Williamson appeared on the shows of Sean Stone, Gary Null and John Shuck. All three have individually pushed and promoted conspiracy theories surrounding 9/11 on their programs, though Williamson did not discuss any theories surrounding the World Trade Center attacks during her appearances, according to a review conducted by CNN\\'s KFile.',\n",

Then, they may offer a contempt resolution, officially notice a committee vote and then hold a vote in committee before any floor action.\\n\\nSome Democrats have been irked by the failure to hold Lewandowski in contempt immediately during the hearing, according to Democratic sources. That flies in the face of current House rules that would have made the process quite cumbersome to immediately hold him in contempt at the hearing.\\n\\nAt a private meeting Wednesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the committee should have immediately held Lewandowski in contempt, but doing so would have been an arduous undertaking under House rules. Her office says that Pelosi was merely expressing frustration at Lewandowski -- not the committee.\\n\\nCorey Lewandowski, the former campaign manager for President Donald Trump, testifies to the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday in Washington.\\n\\nBut the fight over what to do after Lewandowski's testimony showcases the tensions that have been building within the Democratic caucus over the committee's handling of impeachment , with members of the party again at odds over their messaging and strategy during a crucial time facing their majority. In the aftermath of the hearing, some Democrats are openly questioning the wisdom of bringing forward Lewandowski, whose heated exchanges with Democrats and stonewalling of their questions may have overshadowed key aspects of his testimony.\\n\\nRead More\",\n",

       "  'text': '(CNN) As of Friday, it is not exactly clear what led to a mysterious whistleblower complaint filed against President Donald Trump that has taken Washington by storm, but it is clear that the US President wants to use Ukraine against former Vice President Joe Biden.\\n\\nAs with so much in the Trump presidency, it all starts with Hillary Clinton. Here\\'s what we know:\\n\\nGiuliani\\'s accusation\\n\\nRudy Giuliani, the President\\'s attorney and political attack dog, said on CNN Thursday night that his ongoing efforts to pursue Clinton took him to Ukraine . First he alleged, without evidence, that she and Democrats were behind the effort to discredit Paul Manafort, who is currently in prison for, among other things, laundering money he was paid as a political consultant in Ukraine. Then things turned away from Clinton.\\n\\n\"In the course of investigating that, I found out this incredible story about Joe Biden, that he bribed the President of the Ukraine in order to fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son,\" said Giuliani, alleging a media coverup. \"That is an astounding scandal of major proportions, which all of you have covered up for five or six months.\"\\n\\nFrom there the interview with CNN\\'s Chris Cuomo went completely off the rails and Giuliani eventually admitted he had asked the current Ukrainian government to look into Biden.\\n\\n\"Of course I did!\" he said.\\n\\nBut the President\\'s attorney trying to get action from Ukraine is one thing. It would be something different entirely if the administration used official leverage to get a foreign country to investigate a US political rival, especially just months after special counsel Robert Mueller detailed multiple interactions between Trump\\'s 2016 campaign and Russia but found nothing rising to the level of coordination between campaign associates and officials and Russian governmental officials.\\n\\nTrump spoke with Ukraine\\'s President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 and that phone call may be part of what led to the complaint against Trump.\\n\\nAsked Friday about that July 25 call and whether he mentioned Biden to the Ukrainian President, Trump tried to deflect back to Biden . \"It doesn\\'t matter what I discuss,\" he said. \"But I will say this: Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden\\'s statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he\\'s not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case.\" On Friday afternoon, the Wall Street Journal reported that on that phone call Trump pressured the new president \"about eight times\" to work with Giuliani on Biden, citing people familiar with the matter.\\n\\nVice President Mike Pence recently met with Zelensky and was asked about Giuliani\\'s efforts and whether the administration has held up aid to Ukraine as a result.\\n\\nREPORTER: Specifically, number one, did you discuss Joe Biden at all during that meeting yesterday with the Ukrainian President? And number two, can you assure Ukraine that the hold-up of that money has absolutely nothing to do with efforts, including by Rudy Giuliani, to try to dig up dirt on the Biden family?\\n\\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, on the first question, the answer is no. But we — with President Zelensky yesterday, we discussed — we discussed America\\'s support for Ukraine and the upcoming decision the President will make on the latest tranche of financial support in great detail.\\n\\nUkraine uses the aid in its efforts against Russian separatists, part of a long-term conflict with Russia.\\n\\nBiden\\'s efforts in Ukraine\\n\\nDespite Giuliani\\'s allegation, there has been no media coverup of the allegations against Biden. The New York Times wrote about Biden\\'s son and his activities back in May and made clear that Trump\\'s allies were pushing it. The President tweeted about it at the time. Since then, Trump, Giuliani and others have come back to the story repeatedly.\\n\\nAsked about Trump\\'s statement Friday, Biden said \"Not one single credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertion.\"\\n\\n\"Not one single one, and so I have no comment except the President should start to be (the) President,\" Biden said.\\n\\nI sure wish Sen Richard Burr was as interested in Biden\\'s cushy deals w/ Ukraine & China while VP than he is in the harassment of @DonaldJTrumpJr over a CLOSED witch hunt. #Enough — Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) May 9, 2019\\n\\nThe crux of Giuliani\\'s allegation is that Joe Biden tried to have Ukraine\\'s top prosecutor ousted in 2016 because of an investigation into Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company. At the time, Hunter Biden was serving on Burisma\\'s board.\\n\\nBut the reality is much more nuanced.\\n\\nIt is absolutely true that at the same time Burisma was being investigated, western governments, including the Obama administration wanted the prosecutor removed due to concerns about corruption in his own office. Biden too opposed the prosecutor in Ukraine, Viktor Shokin, and threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine. He\\'s actually bragged about it. Recounting a trip he made to Kiev in 2016, he said it showed the US was able to get Ukraine to take corruption more seriously.\\n\\n\"I looked at them and said: I\\'m leaving in six hours,\" Biden said during an event at the Council of Foreign Relations in 2018 . \"If the prosecutor is not fired, you\\'re not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\"\\n\\nNone of this is a particularly good look for the Bidens, but there\\'s no proof or suggestion of any actual wrongdoing.\\n\\nAt least one former official in the prosecutor\\'s office said the investigation into Burisma had already been shelved by the time Joe Biden was threatening to withhold financial aid unless Ukraine replaced its top prosecutor. It\\'s also not clear if Hunter Biden was a focus of that investigation when it was occurring.\\n\\nIn an interview on May 14 posted on Facebook by his assistant, Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yury Lutsenko said Burisma paid an entity connected to Hunter Biden \"millions,\" but added, \"from my point of view, a board member can be paid whatever a company decides ... they didn\\'t violate any Ukrainian laws.\"\\n\\nHe said that he said it was a matter for US law to consider, not Ukrainian investigators.\\n\\nLutsenko in May said he was looking to \"reanimate\" an investigation of Burisma, Hunter Biden\\'s former employer -- but that apparently never happened. Lutsenko left office in August after the new administration of Zelensky took office.\\n\\nGiuliani himself went to meet with a representative of Zelensky after the President\\'s call with Trump in July.\\n\\nAccording to Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Ukrainian officials understand there is a link between what Giuliani was asking of the Ukrainians to do and getting US military aid.\\n\\nMurphy met with the Ukrainian President a few weeks ago and described the scene on Twitter.\\n\\n\"Zelensky did not explicitly connect the two in our meeting, but he was VERY concerned about the cut off of aid, and VERY aware of the conversations that Rudy Giuliani was having with his team. I told him it was best to ignore requests from Trump\\'s campaign operatives. He agreed,\" Murphy explained in a series of tweets.\\n\\nZelensky did not explicitly connect the two in our meeting, but he was VERY concerned about the cut off of aid, and VERY aware of the conversations that Rudy Giuliani was having with his team. I told him it was best to ignore requests from Trump\\'s campaign operatives. He agreed. — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) September 20, 2019\\n\\nI don\\'t know what is in the whistleblower complaint, but it was clear to me that Ukraine officials were worried about the consequences of ignoring Giuliani\\'s demands. And of course they were. That\\'s why presidents shouldn\\'t have their campaigns talking to foreign leaders. — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) September 20, 2019\\n\\nTrump\\'s playbook\\n\\nFostering conspiracy theories about his rival was a strategy that worked for Trump in 2016 as he used decades of conservative conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton to label her \"crooked\" and suggest she should be in jail rather than the White House.\\n\\nBiden, however, is not followed by the same political taint as the Clintons and the effort by Trump and his allies may now have led to a whistleblower sounding the alarm under a law meant to protect intelligence officials for uncovering improper activity.\\n\\nThe specifics of the whistleblower complaint remain a mystery and could remain that way as Trump\\'s new acting Director of National Intelligence refuses to share information about the complaint with Congress. The Intelligence Community Inspector General has caused alarm by publicly saying he is being kept from doing his job.\\n\\nFather and son\\n\\nHunter Biden\\'s personal life and substance abuse issues have already caused angst for the former vice president.\\n\\nThe overlap between the father and son\\'s political and business interests have fueled GOP attacks that Biden is little more than a self-interested politician. Whether the facts fully support that case appears to be an afterthought for his critics.\\n\\nGOP researchers have been digging through Hunter Biden\\'s career history as well as the points where it appears to intersect with his father\\'s, particularly where it pertains to Ukraine and China, another topic Giuliani brought up during his interview with Cuomo.',\n",

       "  'text': \"(CNN) First things first: The theme song of the week is Live with Regis and Kathie Lee .\\n\\nA new Monmouth University poll of New Jersey's potential Democratic primary voters finds that former Vice President Joe Biden leads the Democratic presidential primary race with 26%. He's followed by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 20%, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at 18% and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker at 9%.\\n\\nWhat's the point: This poll gives you an idea of how much Booker's campaign is struggling at this moment. It's one thing not to be leading nationally or in early primary states. It's another thing entirely to be in a distant fourth place and lower than 10% in the state where you're a sitting US senator.\\n\\nBut Booker can take comfort in not being alone. Many of his fellow Democrats are also trailing in the Democratic primary polling in their home states:\\n\\nThe fact that so many Democratic candidates aren't winning in their home states is not a good sign. These are the voters who know you best and should be the most behind you.\\n\\nIndeed, almost every eventual major party nominee since 1980 was leading in their home state in the poll taken closest to this point. The only known exception was Democrat John Kerry in 2003, who was in second place at 23% in Massachusetts. Additionally, there was no polling in Minnesota in 1983, though Walter Mondale was crushing the field at 46% in next door Iowa.\\n\\nIn September 2015, Democrat Hillary Clinton was lapping the field with 45% in a Siena poll of New York Democrats. Republican Donald Trump was well ahead his GOP opponents, too, with 34% among New York Republicans.\\n\\nFurther, Clinton and Trump were actually on the lower end of where a majority of eventual nominees were polling in their home states at this point. The average share in home state polling was 52% for the 14 major party nominees who ran in cycles in which an incumbent was not running for their party's nomination.\\n\\nNone of the candidates who are behind in their home states are anywhere close to that right now.\\n\\nThe only candidate who we can say with any real certainty is ahead in his home state is Biden. He was well ahead in Delaware last year and has been consistently in the lead in nearby Pennsylvania this year.\\n\\nSanders also may be out in front in Vermont, but we have no polling from there.\\n\\nThe fact that so many candidates are polling poorly in their home state speaks in some ways to the nationalization of presidential campaigns. It also speaks to the fact that we have a lot of candidates who are running and just aren't connecting right now.\\n\\nFor better or worse, this is pretty much the same top tier primary race no matter where you are in this country.\",\n",

       " {'title': 'New details reveal acrimonious split between Epstein and Duke of York',\n",
       "  'authors': ['Vicky Ward'],\n",
       "  'text': '(CNN) On August 19, Buckingham Palace put out a statement signed by Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, that was emphatic in distancing the British Royal from the late disgraced financier, Jeffrey Epstein.\\n\\n\"His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behavior is abhorrent,\" it said in part\\n\\nThe statement came days after The Mail On Sunday published grainy video footage that the British paper said showed the prince at the door of Epstein\\'s Manhattan townhouse in 2010.\\n\\nBy then Epstein was a registered sex offender who had avoided a federal trial at the time and served only 13 months in jail for state prostitution charges over his involvement with underage girls. He was accused of paying hundreds of dollars in cash to girls as young as 14 to have sex with him at his Upper East Side home and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and paid some of his victims to recruit other girls for him to abuse.\\n\\nIn 2015, one of Epstein\\'s accusers, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, said in a federal court filing that she was forced to have sex with the prince while underage. Prince Andrew has \"emphatically denied\" any sexual contact with Virginia Roberts.\\n\\nWhile the statement was intended to clarify the details of a relationship that had plagued the British prince for almost a decade, the reality is that it had ended years earlier in a dramatic chain of events, some of which have never been told before.\\n\\nThe more than decade-long friendship between Prince Andrew and Epstein, who died by suicide in his jail cell on August 10, ended in the Spring of 2011, when Epstein threatened legal action against Prince Andrew\\'s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York.\\n\\nAccording to interviews with three people with direct knowledge of the events, Epstein grew irate in late February 2011 after the New York Post published a photograph of the prince walking in Central Park with Epstein in late December 2010.\\n\\nThe accompanying article , headlined \"Prince & Perv,\" generated a barrage of negative publicity about the prince\\'s years-long friendship with Epstein. On March 7, 2011, Sarah Ferguson admitted publicly that she had accepted GBP 15,000 ($24,000) from Epstein to help pay an employee to whom she owed money.\\n\\nOn the advice of her publicist, James Henderson, the Duchess gave an interview to London\\'s Evening Standard in which she expressed extreme contrition for her lack of judgment by accepting the funds from Epstein. With the interview, she put a clear divide between herself and Epstein. \"I abhor pedophilia,\" she said, adding that she\\'d had no knowledge of Epstein\\'s alleged relationships with under-age girls when she took the money.\\n\\nAccording to Henderson, Epstein\\'s reaction to Ferguson\\'s statement was swift and dramatic. First Henderson received what he described as a \"deeply unpleasant\" phone call from Epstein, who threatened Henderson with a defamation lawsuit if a statement was not issued retracting the word \"pedophile.\"\\n\\n\"It was so unpleasant that I was left slightly rattled and I saved his number so I\\'d never have to take a call from him again,\" Henderson told CNN.\\n\\nNext, the Duchess received a letter threatening legal action from an Epstein lawyer and demanding a retraction, according to Henderson. The letter was sent to Ferguson\\'s lawyer at Schillings in London, according to Henderson, who says he advised the Duchess not to retract her statement.\\n\\nShortly after, Epstein, who had retained the services of Los Angeles publicity firm Sitrick & Company years earlier, now turned to Sitrick for help with the situation. The head and founder of the firm, Michael Sitrick, said he in turn recommended that Epstein hire a new lawyer, the UK defamation attorney Paul Tweed.\\n\\nThat solution didn\\'t work. Sitrick ended up suing Epstein for failing to pay his bills, and Tweed eventually stopped working for him as well. Tweed told CNN that he stopped working on the matter after \"my advices were not acceptable to Epstein.\"\\n\\nAccording to court documents related to Sitrick\\'s lawsuit against Epstein and obtained by CNN, Sitrick\\'s employees, in consultation with Tweed, tried to construct language to propose to Fergie that would serve as some sort of retraction by the Duchess of York.\\n\\nAt one point, Henderson says he was shown a draft statement that asked for a retraction of every single one of the Duchess\\'s comments.\\n\\nUltimately, it was all for naught. On Henderson\\'s advice, the Duchess never retracted her statements. Records show that in 2014 Sitrick sued Epstein for payment of more than $71,000 in unpaid bills and received a default judgment in his favor.\\n\\nIn a bit of irony, while the incident marked the end of the relationship between Epstein and Prince Andrew, it also led to a friendship between Tweed and the former royal couple. Tweed was photographed last week golfing with Prince Andrew.\\n\\nThe Duchess had been so impressed by his tenacity in 2011 she wound up hiring him a few years later, according to Henderson.\\n\\nHowever, the Epstein issue has continued to plague the Duke of York, especially since the Giuffre allegations became public in 2015. (A photograph of the Duke with his arm around Giuffre\\'s waist allegedly taken in 2001 first surfaced in Britain\\'s Mail on Sunday in 2011.)\\n\\nA photograph appearing to show Prince Andrew with Jeffrey Epstein\\'s accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre and, in the background, Ghislaine Maxwell.\\n\\nA federal judge has ruled that some documents related to the case could be unsealed\\n\\nLawyers for Giuffre have asked for a meeting with the Duke to explore his relationship with Epstein. He did not answer their requests, according to Giuffre\\'s lawyers. Buckingham Palace reiterated its statement that Prince Andrew had never had any form of sexual contact with Giuffre.\\n\\nOn Friday, September 20, Giuffre reiterated her allegations about Prince Andrew on NBC\\'s Today Show , where she appeared with five other alleged Epstein victims. In the segment, Giuffre recounts an incident in which she went out to a club in London with Epstein, his close friend Ghislaine Maxwell, and Prince Andrew. In the car ride back from the club, Giuffre said that Maxwell told her the prince was coming back to her house and that she wanted her to \"do for him what you do for Epstein.\"\\n\\n\"I just couldn\\'t believe it,\" Giuffre Roberts told NBC. \"I couldn\\'t believe that even royalty were involved.\"\\n\\nIn a statement to CNN, Buckingham Palace said that \"It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts.

       "  'authors': ['Manu Raju', 'Jeff Zeleny'],\n",
       "  'text': '(CNN) House Democrats are nearing a \"tipping point\" on impeachment in the wake of the Trump administration blocking a whistleblower complaint\\'s release to Congress, with moderate Democrats showing new openness to moving ahead and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi offering a fresh sign she\\'s easing from her resistance.\\n\\nPelosi, who sharpened her rhetoric over the weekend , is still not committing to moving forward with impeachment proceedings -- but she is feeling the tide turn.\\n\\nIn a brief interview with CNN as she flew from New York to Washington Monday, Pelosi again declined to say whether she would fully endorse initiating an impeachment inquiry when she meets with committee chairmen and members of the Democratic caucus on Tuesday. But she left little doubt the developments around the whistleblower\\'s complaint had dramatically escalated the standoff with President Donald Trump and a move toward impeachment proceedings was all but certain.\\n\\n\"We will have no choice,\" Pelosi said of ultimately initiating an impeachment inquiry. She did not say whether the move toward impeachment could be slowed if the White House provided the whistleblower\\'s report.\\n\\nDuring the flight, Pelosi read a Washington Post op-ed from seven freshman Democrats who made the case for impeachment.\\n\\nShe said she had advance notice the lawmakers were planning to join forces to collectively argue the president\\'s actions \"represent an impeachable offense.\"\\n\\n\"It will be a big week,\" Pelosi said.\\n\\nThe reason: The substance of the complaint is not yet clear. And it\\'s still unclear how the Trump administration will respond.\\n\\nMultiple Democratic sources told CNN that if the White House completely stonewalls Democrats for the information, it will make the calculus easier for moving forward with impeachment proceedings. But if the White House provides a transcript, or seeks to muddy the waters in its response, that could make it more challenging for Democrats to unify behind impeachment, even after President Donald Trump\\'s admission of discussing Vice President Joe Biden and his son in his phone call with the Ukrainian leader.\\n\\nThat\\'s why this week is critical for House Democrats to decide which course to take. They are awaiting to see how the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, responds during Thursday\\'s high-stakes hearing before the House Intelligence Committee -- and whether the administration provides any more details about Trump\\'s conversations with Ukrainian leaders or the substance of the whistleblower complaint.\\n\\nPlus, Pelosi and House Democratic leaders are waiting to see how members respond -- particularly ones in difficult races who represent GOP-leaning districts -- to see if it\\'s time to move ahead. Pelosi, a savvy vote counter, has no desire to move forward with impeachment if it lacks 218 votes in the House, Democratic sources say, and before the Ukraine controversy, it is almost certain that the House Democrats would have fallen well short of that majority threshold. That could change depending on how the latest controversy shakes out.\\n\\nThe House Democratic caucus will meet Tuesday afternoon, according to three Democratic sources. A leadership aide told CNN that the topic is likely to be about the next steps on investigations.\\n\\n\"The dominant focus of the caucus on Wednesday is trade, a second caucus has been added to ensure adequate time for member discussion on the whistleblower matter and a number of other pressing matters on Tuesday afternoon,\" a Democratic leadership aide said in a statement Monday evening.\\n\\n\\'When are Democrats going to get tough?\\'\\n\\nThe impeachment fight remains a divisive issue in the party as Democratic leaders continue their investigations into the Trump administration -- including a new subpoena threat from a trio of House chairmen -- following a steady stream of developments on the issue over the past couple days.\\n\\nDemocrats, including freshmen from Trump districts and moderates who have resisted calls for impeachment, are telling their colleagues privately they are prepared to announce their support for impeachment proceedings if the controversy continues to grow -- namely if there\\'s evidence that Trump sought to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for investigating the Bidens, according to Democratic sources involved in the conversations.\\n\\nThat could change the calculus for Pelosi, who has in part resisted moving forward on impeachment because she has sought to protect vulnerable Democrats in GOP-leaning districts who could face voter backlash over impeachment. But if those members come out in support of impeachment proceedings, Pelosi is bound to shift her positioning as well, according to Democrats close to the speaker.\\n\\n\"I think we\\'re reaching a tipping point both within our base and within our caucus,\" Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat on the House Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees, told CNN on Monday.\\n\\n\"This weekend, all I hear at home is when are Democrats going to get tough?\" Connolly said. \"We are looking weak.\"\\n\\nSo far, as many as 137 House Democrats have publicly stated their support for an impeachment inquiry into Trump, according a CNN count -- more than half the caucus and with dozens having joined in the past two months. But that number is still far below a majority of House members and Pelosi has long warned of the political consequences of taking such a step against the Presidents.\\n\\nSpeaking to CNN\\'s Poppy Harlow on \"Newsroom\" Monday, Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez of Texas said if Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine in exchange for a reopening of an investigation into Biden\\'s son, he would support an impeachment inquiry.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think we have a choice under the Constitution. We must move forward with impeachment proceedings. I don\\'t think we\\'ll have much of a choice,\" Gonzalez said.\\n\\nNew subpoena threat\\n\\nThe new comments from Democratic lawmakers Monday comes as three House committees threatened to subpoena the State Department over \"documents the State Department has been withholding in response to a letter the Chairmen sent two weeks ago relating to efforts by the President and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to solicit the help of a foreign power to interfere in the 2020 Presidential Election.\" Three chairmen -- House intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel and Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings -- authored a letter Monday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\\n\\n\"Seeking to enlist a foreign actor to interfere with an American election undermines our sovereignty, democracy, and the Constitution, which the President is sworn to preserve, protect, and defend,\" the three chairmen wrote jointly. \"Yet the President and his personal attorney now appear to be openly engaging in precisely this type of abuse of power involving the Ukrainian government ahead of the 2020 election.\"\\n\\nTrump acknowledged on Sunday that he discussed the former vice president in a July call with Ukraine\\'s president. CNN has previously reported that Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the call to investigate Biden\\'s son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was also part of the whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, which hasn\\'t been shared with lawmakers despite calls from Democrats. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.\\n\\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Monday.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington (CNN) When the inspector general for the intelligence community alerted lawmakers to a mysterious whistleblower complaint detailing allegations about President Donald Trump\\'s conduct, many who know him, including some who are skeptical of the complaint, said his reputation and credibility caused them to take his concerns seriously.\\n\\n\"As soon as I saw that he had recommended it be sent to Congress, that\\'s all I needed to know it was legit,\" said Mary McCord, the senior litigator from Practice at the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection who worked with Atkinson at the US Attorney\\'s Office and DOJ\\'s National Security Division.\\n\\nSeveral officials who acknowledged they are skeptical of the complaint told CNN the IC IG, Michael Atkinson, is a serious professional and that his recommendation gives them pause when they would have been inclined to dismiss the case otherwise.\\n\\nAtkinson is widely regarded as a career non-partisan with little interest in the public limelight but he currently finds himself at the center of the high profile controversy related to whether the whistleblower complaint\\n\\nHis recommendation that the complaint, which Atkinson says raised allegations of \"urgent concern,\" be shared with lawmakers has fueled the escalating standoff between the director of national intelligence and Congress while Trump has continued to publicly question the whistleblower\\'s motives for speaking out.\\n\\nBut Atkinson has stood by his conclusion that the complaint indeed raises concerns that must be handed over to Congress in accordance with the law, despite clashing with his own boss, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, over that determination.\\n\\nThe House Intelligence Committee released a letter from Atkinson last week in which he wrote that he and Maguire, \"are at an impasse\" over that point, marking an unprecedented disagreement between the DNI and IC IG.\\n\\n\"This involves something more sinister, something involving a serious or flagrant abuse or violation of law or misappropriation, and the IG underscored the seriousness of this, and also that this needs to be looked into. And right now, no one is looking into this,\" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said Friday.\\n\\nAppointed as IC IG by Trump in 2018, Atkinson\\'s long-standing reputation as a straight-shooter with professional integrity has bolstered the legitimacy of the whistleblower complaint despite the President\\'s attempts to paint it as a partisan attack, multiple sources have told CNN.\\n\\nCredible sense of urgency\\n\\nPrior to his Senate confirmation to become IC IG in 2018, Atkinson worked for the Justice Department for over 15 years, according to his biography on the ODNI website\\n\\nFrom 2002 through 2006, Atkinson worked as a trial attorney in DOJ\\'s Criminal Division, Fraud Section. He then served as an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Columbia from 2006 through 2016, where he was the acting chief and deputy chief of the Fraud and Public Corruption Section.\\n\\nSome of Atkinson\\'s former colleagues agreed that his credentials as a non-partisan and relative obscurity prior to becoming involved in the whistleblower case lend weight to the seriousness of the complaint.\\n\\nAtkinson brought several major cases to the US Attorney\\'s Office that were \"the result of thorough, quiet investigation,\" according to McCord, who served as the acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security at DOJ from 2016 to 2017 and Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division from 2014 to 2016.\\n\\nThat quiet, non-partisan approach to his work is why McCord believed he would be a good fit for the IC IG role.\\n\\n\"The mere fact he was not on anyone\\'s radar is points to the fact that his sense of urgency is credible,\" she said. \"People don\\'t know who he is and that\\'s because he does his job. He\\'s the IG and most of that work is not in the public sphere.\"\\n\\n\"You would not know which political party he favors by working with him. I worked with him for years. That\\'s the other reason I feel he\\'s so credible in this space,\" McCord added.\\n\\nFormer Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department\\'s National Security Division, John Carlin, told CNN that Atkinson is \"someone who is very deliberate, thoughtful and tries to carefully review facts ... not someone who seeks attention.\"\\n\\n\"So if he is in a situation where something needed to be referred that\\'s because it was his best and informed view of what the law required,\" he said.\\n\\nNot backing down?\\n\\nMcCord told CNN that she believes Atkinson feels strongly that the complaint needs to be reported to Congress but is also trying to respect the hierarchy in place, which includes the DNI.\\n\\nDuring a closed-door briefing with Schiff\\'s committee on Thursday, Atkinson would only discuss the process for his handling of the whistleblower\\'s concerns, the chairman said. Though lawmakers pressed him for details on the complaint, their efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.\\n\\nThe inspector general does not have the authority to discuss the details of the complaint with Congress because the DNI has not shared the actual report with the committee and had apparently not otherwise authorized Atkinson to share those details.\\n\\nAlthough the official details of the complaint have not been provided to members of Congress, Atkinson told the panel during the briefing that it raised concerns about multiple actions but would not say if those instances involved Trump, according to sources familiar with the briefing.\\n\\nAccording to one source, Atkinson referenced \"a sequence of events\" and \"alleged actions\" that took place. However, another source disputed that the IG provided substantive details regarding the whistleblower claim.\\n\\nThe whistleblower\\'s complaint deals at least in part with a July call between Trump and Ukraine\\'s president. CNN has previously reported that Trump pressed Zelensky in the call to investigate Biden\\'s son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. Trump has admitted to discussing Biden with Zelensky but has denied doing anything improper.\\n\\nThere is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.\\n\\nWhile Trump and some Congressional Republicans have attempted to downplay concerns surrounding the complaint, McCord told CNN that she does not see Atkinson backing down from his position.\\n\\n\"If he got to a position where he saw resigning as the only alternative, he would do it ... but there is a lot of space between now and that point,\" McCord added, noting that Maguire is still expected to testify before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday.',\n",

       "  'text': '(CNN) President Donald Trump now acknowledges he brought up Joe Biden in a recent call with the new leader of Ukraine, but says it\\'s no big deal.\\n\\n\"Everybody does it,\" Trump said Monday.\\n\\nThat blasé attitude is not reflected in Congress, where the weekend\\'s revelations have led more Democrats to support an impeachment inquiry against Trump. The worst possible scenario, which not everybody believes, is that Trump used his office and his authority over foreign aid to stir up trouble for a leading 2020 rival.\\n\\nBut the political fight is over more than just whether Trump pressured his Ukrainian counterpart, President Volodymyr Zelensky, to get involved in the US presidential election by investigating Biden and his son, Hunter, over Hunter\\'s former business interests. It\\'s also about what must be shared with Congress after a whistleblower raised the alarm, and just how much Trump has changed what\\'s allowed in American politics.\\n\\n\"I\\'m leading in the polls, they have no idea how they stop me,\" Trump told reporters Tuesday at the United Nations. \"The only way they can try is through impeachment.\"\\n\\nThis is a fast moving scandal that\\'s hard to keep track of. Here\\'s what we know about each of the issues at hand:\\n\\nDid Trump talk to Ukraine\\'s new president about Joe Biden?\\n\\nYes. Trump initially denied it, but over the weekend admitted that when he talked to Zelensky on July 25, he brought up Joe Biden. Trump also made clear that in his mind, Biden = corruption.\\n\\nOn Sunday, Trump said of the conversation:\\n\\n\"We had a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption -- all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don\\'t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son (adding to the corruption),\" Trump told reporters.\\n\\nThe call is part of the whistleblower complaint against Trump. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump told Zelensky \"that he should work with [Mr. Giuliani] on Biden, and that people in Washington wanted to know\" whether allegations were true or not, a person familiar with the matter said, according to the Journal. While Trump pressed Zelensky, he did not bring up military aid on the call, CNN reported Friday.\\n\\nMr. Giuliani is former New York mayor and Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who has been calling for months for a new inquiry into Biden\\'s role in a corruption purge in Ukraine during the Obama administration. He renewed those calls during a remarkable interview with CNN\\'s Chris Cuomo last Thursday during which he said he asked officials in Ukraine to investigate Biden.\\n\\nWhy is anyone suggesting Trump pressured Zelensky or tied a Biden investigation to military aid?\\n\\nAt the same time Trump was mentioning Biden to Zelensky, Giuliani was actively pushing Ukraine\\'s top prosecutor, who has since left that position, to officially investigate Biden and his son.\\n\\nThat\\'s also about the same time Trump\\'s administration was putting the skids on nearly $400 million aid, including $250 million in military aid and $141 million from the State Department, US officials familiar with the matter tell CNN.\\n\\nSen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, said on Twitter last week that after he met recently with Zelensky, there was no question the Ukrainian was concerned both about the aid being cut off and about Giuliani\\'s calls for an investigation in Biden.\\n\\n\"Zelensky did not explicitly connect the two in our meeting, but he was VERY concerned about the cut off of aid, and VERY aware of the conversations that Rudy Giuliani was having with his team. I told him it was best to ignore requests from Trump\\'s campaign operatives. He agreed,\" Murphy explained in a series of tweets.\\n\\nZelensky did not explicitly connect the two in our meeting, but he was VERY concerned about the cut off of aid, and VERY aware of the conversations that Rudy Giuliani was having with his team. I told him it was best to ignore requests from Trump\\'s campaign operatives. He agreed. — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) September 20, 2019\\n\\nAn aide to Zelensky, Andriy Yermak, summed up his contacts with Giuliani in an interview published Monday.\\n\\n\"So, Giuliani and I talked on the phone, and after that we personally met in Madrid. I repeated to him the same points. He noted that it was important for him to hear that the new Ukrainian government would preach the principles of openness and legality, will fight corruption, and set as its goal to make Ukraine successful.\"\\n\\nWho is Zelensky?\\n\\nZelensky is a former comedian, and like Trump, a newcomer to politics. Before his election in April, he was better known as the star of a TV show in which he played the President of Ukraine . When he won a landslide victory over Petro Poroshenko, he promised to clean up corruption.\\n\\nDid Zelensky feel pressured by Trump to investigate Biden?\\n\\nThere are conflicting accounts on this. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said over the weekend that his country would not take sides in a US election. \"I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure,\" he told the Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske, according to Reuters . \"This conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on many questions, sometimes requiring serious answers.\"\\n\\nDid Trump directly tie military aid to Ukraine to investigating Biden?\\n\\nWe don\\'t entirely know. It does not appear Trump ever explicitly told Zelensky that if he didn\\'t investigate Biden, he wouldn\\'t get the military aid. There is a transcript of the call, but it\\'s not clear if or when anyone outside the White House will see it. Some details of the call have been reported, including by CNN\\n\\n\"I did not make a statement that \\'you have to do this or I\\'m not going to give you aid.\\' I wouldn\\'t do that. I wouldn\\'t do that,\" Trump told reporters on Monday.\\n\\nHe also suggested it\\'s his hope the call\\'s transcript is released: \"It was a very nice call. I hope you get to see it and I hope you get to see it soon.\"\\n\\nWhen was the military aid to Ukraine frozen?\\n\\nCNN confirmed that Trump asked his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to put a hold on the millions in military aid to Ukraine roughly one week before a call with Zelensky, two senior administration officials said on Monday. Officials from the Office of Management and Budget told officials from the Pentagon and State Department about the freeze at a meeting in mid-July, according to The Washington Post\\n\\nWhen and how were the funds frozen?\\n\\nTrump admitted he withheld the money in comments to reporters at the UN Tuesday. He said he wanted Europe to do more for Ukraine. But then he added the money was ultimately paid. He didn\\'t point out it was ultimately paid because of an objection from Democrats.\\n\\n\"My complaint has always been -- and I\\'d withhold again, and I\\'ll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine,\" he said. Because they not doing it, it\\'s the United States. We\\'re putting up the bulk of the money.\\n\\nMulvaney has long been skeptical of the aid. Former national security adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did not agree on much, but they did agree that Ukraine should get the aid. Congressional staffers say Congress was in the dark on the holdup.\\n\\n\"The administration did not notify us that the aid was frozen,\" according to a Senate aide. \"The House Appropriations Committee learned of it on or about August 23rd and informed us, and then the first news stories appeared days later. In response to our inquiries, DoD confirmed to us that the funds were frozen on August 28th.\"\\n\\nFurther, according to CNN reporting, officials in Ukraine were never formally told the funds were being frozen.\\n\\nWhy does Trump keep returning to Biden and Ukraine?\\n\\nPolitics. Trump wants to attack Biden\\'s credibility. Every time Trump is asked about his conversation with Zelensky, he returns to his message about Biden, as he did on Twitter Monday.\\n\\n\"Now the Fake News Media says I \\'pressured the Ukrainian President at least 8 times during my telephone call with him.\\' This supposedly comes from a so-called \\'whistleblower\\' who they say doesn\\'t even have a first hand account of what was said. More Democrat/Crooked Media con.......Breaking News: The Ukrainian Government just said they weren\\'t pressured at all during the \\'nice\\' call. Sleepy Joe Biden, on the other hand, forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son\\'s company by threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine. That\\'s the real story!\"\\n\\nAn important note: There have been no serious allegations of specific wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. An investigation into a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden was on the board, had been shelved by a prosecutor before Biden and many other Western officials and Ukrainians called for him to step down. Biden had threatened aid in the form of loan guarantees if the prosecutor did not leave office.\\n\\nWhen did Trump\\'s focus on Biden and Ukraine start?\\n\\nThis is a story that has been percolating for some time. Giuliani has long lobbied Ukraine to investigate Biden\\'s call in 2016 to remove the country\\'s top prosecutor, who at one point had been investigating the natural gas company connected to Hunter Biden. CNN reported in August that Giuliani and Yermak, the aide to Zelensky, had spoken several times over the phone and met in Madrid.\\n\\nNow according to The Washington Post, Giuliani said he has had five conversations with Yermak.\\n\\nSeparately, Giuliani told the Post he did not address the issue of US aid to Ukraine in the Madrid person to person meeting this summer. \"I was not involved in the aid at all,\" he said, referring to military aid. \"I had no idea the $250 million was on the table.\"\\n\\nHe said that Yermak was pushing for an Oval Office meeting between Trump and the Ukrainian president and that the Ukrainians were \"embarrassed\" there had not been one yet.\\n\\nGiuliani has said he essentially stumbled upon the Biden element. He had been pushing in Ukraine on an effort to clear Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman who is currently in jail for tax evasion on money he made for political consulting in Ukraine and elsewhere.\\n\\nWhy does Ukraine need US military aid?\\n\\nUkraine is dealing with Russian-backed separatists in the Eastern part of the country and still opposes Russia\\'s 2014 takeover of Crimea, which had been part of Ukraine. The country is very much standing between Vladimir Putin\\'s Russia and the West.\\n\\nWhat is the aid used for?\\n\\nThe assistance, according to previous CNN reports , is for sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, counter-artillery radars, night vision and military medical treatment -- all of which Ukrainians could use to counter pro-Russian separatists.\\n\\nWhat was the official reason that aid to Ukraine was frozen?\\n\\nThe White House has said it wanted to make sure the new administration in Ukraine would stay true to its word and cut down on corruption.\\n\\nVice President Mike Pence, for instance, denied earlier this month that the holdup had anything to do with Biden, but he did say, \"We have great concerns about issues of corruption... I mean, to invest additional taxpayer in Ukraine, the President wants to be assured that those resources are truly making their way to the kind of investments that will contribute to security and stability in Ukraine.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s very similar to language Trump used Sunday, except Trump tied the idea of corruption in Ukraine to Biden, perhaps further suggesting a link between the money and the investigation.\\n\\nTrump returned to corruption during his comments to reporters at the United Nations on Monday.\\n\\n\"If you don\\'t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?\" he said. \"One of the reasons the new president got elected is he was going to stop corruption. It\\'s very important that on occasion you speak to somebody about corruption. Very important.\"\\n\\nHow was the aid unfrozen?\\n\\nThere was bipartisan opposition to the freeze up on Capitol Hill. CNN reported on September 12 that the administration had suddenly dropped its opposition to the aid after Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, got bipartisan support for an amendment to force the administration\\'s hand. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and Trump ally who nevertheless supported the aid to Ukraine, gave Durbin credit for making the aid happen.\\n\\n\"So why was it released? Because of your amendment, that\\'s why it was released,\" Graham said during an appropriations hearing earlier in September. \"Because I was going to vote for it, so I think they got the message. If you\\'re listening in the Ukraine on C-SPAN, you\\'re going to get the money.\"\\n\\nHas Ukraine gotten any of the aid?\\n\\n\"The Department of Defense was able to begin obligating these funds last week. We will continue to leverage all available tools to expedite the implementation of these programs. We expect the majority of the funds to be obligated by the end of the fiscal year,\" according to Cmdr. Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman.\\n\\nSome $60 million had been obligated fairly quickly (as of last Monday), according to a US official. The Pentagon is confident that it can obligate $220 million before the end of the fiscal year and is working with Congress to get an extension to continue the aid delivery. The House voted last week to extend the window for the aid through November.\\n\\nWhy is it important when Trump talked to Zelensky?\\n\\nIt\\'s completely incredible that Trump may have pressured the Ukrainian president, essentially asking him to investigate a US political rival, in the very midst of denying his campaign colluded with Russia\\'s election interference in 2016.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, July 24, former special counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress about all of the Trump campaign interactions with Russia in 2016 and explained why his report did not recommend charges against the President or his aides for seeking political help from a foreign government.\\n\\n\"NO COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION!\" Trump tweeted that day and his allies hailed the end of calls for impeachment. Turns out things were just beginning. He talked to Zelensky the next day.\\n\\nWhat is the fight over the whistleblower?\\n\\nWhile there had been plenty of reporting on Biden\\'s involvement in the Ukraine, on Giuliani\\'s quest to highlight it for campaign season and on the temporary halt of aid to Ukraine, the whistleblower complaint is what tied them all together.\\n\\nBut the White House tried very hard to keep it quiet. While Congress should be entitled under the law to hear about whistleblower complaints, the White House had justified keeping it from Congress. The Intelligence Community Inspector General informed lawmakers that the complaint existed, but no one outside the intelligence community or the White House has actually seen it.\\n\\nThat\\'s because the DNI has, on the advice of the White House and Department of Justice, resisted providing the report to Congress and have said it is not actually covered by the whistleblower law.\\n\\nWhat are Democrats saying?\\n\\nEven some Democrats who had opposed impeachment proceedings against Trump are now saying there is no alternative.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think we have a choice under the Constitution,\" said Texas Rep. Vicente Gonzalez on CNN Monday. \"We must move forward with impeachment proceedings.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think we\\'ll have much of a choice,\" he said. \"It seems like the President is really pushing us for impeachment proceedings. I don\\'t know if he\\'s baiting us because he has a personal agenda that he thinks this might be helpful to him.\"\\n\\nWhat is Trump saying now?\\n\\nHe was asked exactly during an appearance Monday at the United Nations if he\\'s taking impeachment seriously.\\n\\n\"Not at all seriously,\" Trump said, denying any wrongdoing and staying impeccably on-message that this whole thing has more to do with Biden.\\n\\n\"We had a perfect phone call with the president of Ukraine,\" Trump said. \"Everybody knows it\\'s just a Democrat witch hunt. Here we go again. They failed with Russia, they failed with recession and now they\\'re bringing this up. The one who has the problem is Biden. Biden did what they would like to have me do except one problem, I didn\\'t do it.\"\\n\\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington (CNN) The US is making a push for new international sanctions against Venezuela, a senior State Department official said Monday, as Latin American states voted to pursue and possibly extradite regime leaders.\\n\\nThe US wants to get more countries, and the European Union in particular, to impose sanctions on the embattled regime of President Nicolas Maduro and keep Venezuela in the spotlight as the world gathers for the United Nations General Assembly , the State Department official said.\\n\\n\"We want to make sure the issue of a transition in Venezuela remains very high on the international agenda,\" a State Department official said Monday. \"There have been moments ... in the last six months, where people have said, \\'Oh, the (administration) isn\\'t paying attention to Venezuela.\\' That\\'s wrong, that is always wrong. ... On the contrary, it is going to come up a lot this week.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'re also asking the EU to impose the kind of sanctions that we have, that Brazil has, that Canada has,\" said the official, who spoke on background.\\n\\nThe official spoke shortly before the Organization of American States voted to invoke a treaty of mutual assistance that hasn\\'t been triggered since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, part of the effort to increase pressure on the Maduro regime. A Wednesday meeting of heads of government will also focus on Venezuela, the State Department official said.\\n\\n\\'Concerted action\\'\\n\\nThe Trump administration\\'s overall goal at the UN General Assembly \"is to get concerted action,\" said the State Department official, who added that the prospect of talks with the Maduro regime seemed remote.\\n\\n\"Could people get back to the table? My answer is yes, but only if there\\'s a clear signal on the part of the regime that there\\'s a clear interest in getting back\" to a political transition, which to date, hasn\\'t been seen, the official said.\\n\\nThe Organization of American States met later Monday to invoke the Rio Treaty, which includes an article that states an attack against one is to be considered an attack against all. The State Department official said the treaty functions as \"a very useful coordinating mechanism for the economic and diplomatic pressures and sanctions we\\'d like to see more countries impose.\"\\n\\nIn a 16-1 vote, the OAS agreed it would work to pursue, prosecute and extradite officials in the Maduro government guilty of corruption, egregious human rights abuse, drug trafficking and belonging to transnational criminal organizations.\\n\\nUnder the agreement, they could be pursued and prosecuted in all 16 countries. Uruguay was the sole vote against, while Cuba was absent and Trinidad and Tobago abstained.\\n\\n\\'Bellicose moves\\'\\n\\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo laid the groundwork for invoking the Rio Treaty on September 11, when he made the case that Venezuela is a regional threat.\\n\\n\"Recent bellicose moves by the Venezuelan military to deploy along the border with Colombia as well as the presence of illegal armed groups and terrorist organizations in Venezuelan territory demonstrate that Nicolas Maduro not only poses a threat to the Venezuelan people, his actions threaten the peace and security of Venezuela\\'s neighbors,\" Pompeo said. \"Catastrophic economic policies and political repression continue to drive this unprecedented refugee crisis, straining the ability of governments to respond.\"\\n\\nThe State Department official said Monday that the Rio Treaty would help countries establish the legal basis to impose sanctions against the Maduro regime.\\n\\nA number of countries don\\'t have the domestic laws in place to justify the imposition of sanctions, the official said. Signing the treaty would give those countries the legal authority to do so. \"They\\'ll be able to say they\\'re bound by the Rio Treaty. Once you sign a treaty it becomes the binding law of the land,\" the official said.\\n\\n\\'Narco-terrorists\\'\\n\\n\"If the meeting of ministers adopts a proposal to restrict travel by regime big shots ... then they would have a legal basis for implementing that in each of the countries that is a signatory. ... it\\'s likely to lead to a wider imposition of sanctions,\" the official said.\\n\\n\"Our goal is to move more countries to the imposition of sanctions, which we think has a really significant economic and psychological effect on the regime,\" the State Department official added.\\n\\nSpeaking at the OAS meeting later Monday, Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Trujillo said invoking the treaty would make any action or sanction decided on in the gathering \"legitimate under international law.\" It is the \"only inter-American instrument that gives us the legal instrument to take actions ... to protect democracy, peace and stability in the region,\" Trujillo said.\\n\\nBrazil\\'s Foreign Minister Ernesto Araújo said that Maduro has made the country a haven \"for all types of organized and transnational crime\" and \"narco-terrorists.\"\\n\\n\"They transformed the nation on the part of crime,\" Araújo said through a translator, calling it \"another aspect of the nightmare Venezuelans are going through.\" Brazil has opened its doors to Venezuelan refugees, Araújo said, but \"it is clear that the final solution for the Venezuelan tragedy necessarily means Venezuela returns to democracy.\"\\n\\nThe State Department official emphasized that the battle against Maduro is broader than a US-Venezuela standoff.\\n\\n\\'Very unseemly\\'\\n\\n\"Some people cast this struggle as a struggle between the United States and the Maduro regime, which it is not, it\\'s really a struggle between the people of Venezuela and the Maduro regime,\" the official said.\\n\\nThe official refused to say whether the OAS move would result in the closing of Venezuela\\'s air space or to discuss other potential steps the group could take, but said that the Trump administration is committed to increasing the pressure on Maduro.\\n\\nPart of that is having Europe step up, the official said.\\n\\nThe EU has prepared and could impose a set of sanctions directly related to the torture and death of Venezuelan Navy Captain Rafael Acosta , who was allegedly tortured to death after being imprisoned for conspiring to overthrow Maduro.\\n\\n\"Then we would like to see sanctions that affect broader targets in the regime,\" said the State Department official.\\n\\nSpeaking of Europe, the official added that, \"I think we all agree their mechanisms are slow,\" but the US hopes to \"see movement in October\" against Maduro.\\n\\nAs part of that, the US would like to see the EU ensure that Venezuelans political elites can\\'t use the continent as a place to hide or keep their families and wealth. \"We think there\\'s something very unseemly about allowing Europe to become a resort\" for the country\\'s bigwigs and their families, the official said.',\n",

       "  'text': 'New York (CNN) The United Nations gathered world leaders to present concrete plans to tackle the climate crisis Monday, making made clear it didn\\'t want to hear platitudes, as scientists, activists and religious leaders warned that urgent steps are needed to slow rising temperatures that intensify devastating natural disasters.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump paid a flying visit but said nothing.\\n\\n\"If we don\\'t urgently change our ways of life, we jeopardize life itself,\" Secretary-General António Guterres said, while youth leader Greta Thunberg excoriated leaders.\\n\\n\"People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing,\" she said, days after cities worldwide were galvanized by climate protestors. \"We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk is the money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth.\"\\n\\nAbsent from the conversation: the United States, one of the world\\'s largest emitters of greenhouse gases.\\n\\n\\'Very important\\'\\n\\nTrump appeared at the Climate Action Summit in New York, in an impromptu stop on his way to his administration\\'s priority event on religious freedom. But the US did not speak at the event and the President, who has repeatedly said he thinks climate change is a hoax, left after 15 minutes.\\n\\nTrump pulled the US out of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, which has been ratified by at least 186 nations and calls for action to stop global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees. His administration has systematically moved to roll back US regulations meant to protect water and air quality, and limit greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\\nAsked why he\\'d put in an appearance at the summit, the US President told reporters that he is \"a big believer in clean air and clean water, and all countries should get together and do that, and they should do it for themselves. Very, very important.\"\\n\\nGuterres has made climate change a signature issue and told leaders attending the 74th United Nations General Assembly to \"come with concrete plans\" and not just \"beautiful speeches.\"\\n\\nThe UN leader drew a concrete line, telling leaders they would not get time at the podium unless they came ready to present concrete, realistic ways their countries could help lower emissions by 2020 as part of the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 45% over the next decade and getting to net zero emissions by 2050.\\n\\n\\'Stop\\'\\n\\nIn his opening remarks, Guterres told the audience to look no further than the last few months for the impact the changing climate was having on the world.\\n\\nJune through August, he noted, marked \"the hottest summer in the Northern Hemisphere ever; and the second hottest winter in the Southern Hemisphere ever. The years 2015 to 2019 — the five hottest years on the books ever. Our warming earth is issuing a chilling cry: Stop.\"\\n\\nThe UN released a World Meteorological Organization report to mark the Monday summit showing that a slew of worrying indicators have been accelerating, including sea-level rise, warming global temperatures, shrinkage of ice sheets and carbon pollution.\\n\\nThe report said average global temperatures from 2015 through to the end of 2019 are on pace to be the \"warmest of any equivalent period on record\" and said they are at 1.1 degrees above pre-industrial levels.\\n\\nCountries and cities came ready with plans. German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced her country would double its climate protection funding. \"Germany sees its responsibility on the international stage and on the national stage,\" she said.\\n\\nChile\\'s President Sebastián Echeñique and Montreal Mayor Valerie Plante announced their respective plans to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 or sooner. Costa Rica, Indonesia and China spoke about the economic and business case for shifting to renewable energy and the health case for phasing out coal.\\n\\nA question of political will\\n\\nMaine Gov. Janet Mills and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta spoke about their plans for transitioning to a decarbonized environment and sustainable transit systems. Others spoke about climate finance, small island developing states and other issues.\\n\\nPope Francis called international efforts on climate change \"weak\" to date and asked whether leaders had the necessary political will to bring about change. \"It is necessary to ask whether there is a real political will to allocate greater human, financial and technological resources to mitigate the negative effects of climate change and to help the poorest and most vulnerable populations, who suffer most,\" he said.\\n\\nThunberg was less polite.\\n\\n\"How dare you,\" she said in her remarks at the summit. \"You are failing us, but the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. ... We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now, is where we draw the line.\"',\n",

       "  'authors': ['Paul Leblanc'],\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington (CNN) Former Massachusetts governor and longshot candidate for the GOP nomination for president Bill Weld on Monday accused President Donald Trump of \"treason\" for pressing Ukraine\\'s President to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and stated bluntly \"the penalty for treason under the US code is death.\"\\n\\n\"Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a US election, it couldn\\'t be clearer,\" Weld said in an interview on MSNBC\\'s \"Morning Joe.\" \"And that\\'s not just undermining democratic institutions, that is treason. It\\'s treason pure and simple.\"\\n\\n\"The penalty for treason under the US code is death. That\\'s the only penalty,\" Weld added. \"The penalty under the Constitution is removal from office and that might look like a pretty good alternative to the President if he could work out a plea deal.\"\\n\\nWeld\\'s comments come amid mounting scrutiny of Trump after he acknowledged discussing Biden and his son, Hunter, in a July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The call was part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN.\\n\\nWhite House officials are now considering releasing a transcript of the call, multiple sources have told CNN. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.\\n\\nArticle Three of the Constitution defines treason as \"levying War against [the US] or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.\" The president, the Constitution says, \"shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\"\\n\\nUS code states individuals found guilty of treason \"shall suffer death\" or face imprisonment, a fine, and \"shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.\"\\n\\nWeld made the comments in a joint interview alongside two other Republicans challenging Trump for the GOP nomination, former congressmen Joe Walsh and Mark Sanford.\\n\\n\"Donald Trump needs to be impeached. Period,\" Walsh said. \"As Bill Weld just said, he told a foreign leader two months ago to interfere in our 2020 election. He needs to be impeached.\"\\n\\nSanford, who also served as governor of South Carolina, echoed Weld and Walsh\\'s strong rhetoric.\\n\\n\"I think you know where the three of us are on this larger debate,\" he said.\\n\\nEarlier this month, all three GOP challengers penned an op-ed in The Washington Post lambasting state Republican leaders and Trump for opting to cancel their 2020 presidential primary elections in a show of support for the President.\\n\\n\"The primary nomination process is the only opportunity for Republicans to have a voice in deciding who will represent our party,\" they said. \"Let those voices be heard.\"',\n",

       "  'text': 'The escalating controversy over President Trump’s phone conversation with Ukraine’s president has ignited a battle on Capitol Hill over Democrats’ demands for a copy of the whistleblower complaint against Trump, as some liberal lawmakers threatened subpoenas while Republicans called for restraint while they gather facts.\\n\\nDemocrats have seized on allegations that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate dealings involving 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, citing those claims to revive calls for impeachment.\\n\\nTrump has denied any wrongdoing, but Democrats have been moving full steam ahead, calling for the whistleblower complaint to be released to lawmakers.\\n\\nSOURCE SAYS WHISTLEBLOWER DIDN\\'T HAVE ‘FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE’ OF TRUMP CALL WITH UKRAINE PRESIDENT\\n\\n“The Senate Republican ‘see no evil, hear no evil’ attitude is unacceptable and must change,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Senate floor Monday. “This again is an issue of solemn obligation. There is no wiggle room here, none.”\\n\\nThe New York Democrat earlier in the day wrote a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell asking him to issue a subpoena and hold hearings over the complaint.\\n\\nIn a floor speech Monday afternoon, the Kentucky Republican rebuffed those calls from Democrats, saying the Senate Intelligence Committee has been following an established process and was working to hear from the intelligence community\\'s inspector general this week.\\n\\n“It is regrettable that House Intelligence Committee Chairman [Adam] Schiff and Sen. Schumer have chosen to politicize the issue,” McConnell said, calling for looking into the matter in an “appropriate, deliberate bipartisan manner.”\\n\\nIn a statement Monday, Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley called for lawmakers not to rush to judgment.\\n\\n“One thing we do know is that rampant speculation by politicians and the media is not helpful,” he said. “That’s how the false Russia collusion narrative took root.”\\n\\nHe added: “Let’s not repeat the mistakes of the past. Going forward, it’s important to respect the law and the whistleblower’s confidentiality while we gather the facts of the case. And of course, transparency is always the best policy so long as we don’t endanger national security.”\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Democrats chairing three House committees sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asking the department to produce documents related to the complaint, or face subpoenas.\\n\\n“Seeking to enlist a foreign actor to interfere with an American election undermines our sovereignty, democracy, and the Constitution, which the President is sworn to preserve, protect, and defend,” the chairmen wrote. “Yet the President and his personal attorney now appear to be openly engaging in precisely this type of abuse of power involving the Ukrainian government ahead of the 2020 election.”\\n\\nThe letter was sent by Schiff, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel of New York and Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings of Maryland.\\n\\nAt least one Republican lawmaker, however, has called for the release of the transcript.\\n\\n“At this stage, given the seriousness of the allegations, it’s very important that the transcript and potentially as well the whistleblower come forward,\" said Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, an occasional Trump critic.\\n\\nMeanwhile, a source told Fox News on Monday that the whistleblower who sparked the complaint did not have “firsthand knowledge” of the conversation. The source said that it was made clear in the complaint itself that the whistleblower did not have direct knowledge of the July phone call between Trump and Zelensky.\\n\\nFox News has learned that typically, multiple U.S. officials would be on such calls with the president, but this would indicate the whistleblower was not one of those people. It\\'s unclear if the individual read a transcript of the call, heard about it in conversation or learned of it another way.\\n\\nThese new details have fed into skepticism about the allegations from Trump’s allies in Congress, with some likening it to how Democrats rushed to call for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s impeachment last week. Some Democrats backed off after The New York Times amended an explosive article on new college-era allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh to make clear that the alleged victim did not have any recollection of the alleged episode.\\n\\nOn Fox News’ “Outnumbered Overtime,” GOP Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah on Monday likened the two situations and called for restraint regarding the whistleblower complaint. “I think it’s fair to just take a breath, and say let\\'s just find out the facts and see what happens,” he said.\\n\\nRepublicans also have been trying to return the focus to Biden. Trump allies have claimed son Hunter improperly benefited from business dealings in Ukraine with energy company Burisma Holdings as a member of its board and questioned whether his father, the onetime vice president, helped protect him by seeking the ouster of prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was looking into the company\\'s owner.\\n\\nTrump, in a Sunday night tweet, said the Ukrainian government backed him up by saying he did not pressure them during the phone call. In the same tweet, he said the “real story” was Biden pressuring Ukraine into firing Shokin.\\n\\nBurisma hired Hunter Biden in April 2014, two months after Ukraine\\'s Russia-friendly president was ousted amid protests and as his father was involved heavily in U.S. efforts to support the new pro-Western government and its pledge to fight corruption. The hiring of the younger Biden immediately raised concerns that the Ukrainian firm, whose owner was a political ally of the ousted president, was seeking to gain influence with the Obama administration.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nTwo years later, Biden, as vice president, threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine unless Shokin was fired. Many critics in Ukraine and the West had accused Shokin of being soft on corruption, but he also had been leading an investigation into Burisma\\'s owner.\\n\\nFox News reported on the Biden controversy in April. The New York Times published a lengthy story on the matter in May. But, the controversy flew largely under the radar until last week. While the heat has been on Trump over whether he pressured Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, that firestorm has prompted multiple news outlets to revisit the original Biden controversy in order to provide context.\\n\\nFox News’ Chad Pergram, Jason Donner, Jake Gibson, Ronn Blitzer and The Associated Press contributed to this report.',\n",

       "  'text': 'A newly released two-page memo written by then-Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe outlined how former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein proposed wearing a wire in the White House \"to collect additional evidence on the president’s true intentions,\" and thought the scheme was plausible because \"he was not searched when he entered the White House.\"\\n\\nThe contemporaneous memo, which the Justice Department released after a transparency lawsuit by Judicial Watch, provided the strongest documentary evidence to date to undercut previous claims by DOJ officials that Rosenstein was joking when he apparently made the suggestion.\\n\\nMcCabe said in the partially redacted memo – written May 16, 2017, on the eve of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\\'s appointment -- that Rosenstein offered to wear a recording device to gather evidence on the firing of former FBI Director James Comey and related matters. McCabe noted that he took Rosenstein\\'s suggestion seriously enough that \"I told him that I would discuss the opportunity with my investigative team and get back to him.\"\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO READ THE MEMO\\n\\nThe DOJ and White House have separately rejected McCabe\\'s claims outright and called his credibility into question.\\n\\n\"As our conversation continued, the DAG proposed that he could potentially wear a recording device into the Oval Office to collect additional evidence on the president’s true intentions,\" McCabe wrote in the memo. \"He said he thought this might be possible because he was not searched when he entered the White House.\"\\n\\nAlso in the memo, McCabe -- he\\'d just taken over as acting head of the FBI -- said he began the lunch-hour meeting by informing Rosenstein that he had opened an investigation into the president concerning possible collusion and obstruction.\\n\\n\"I began by telling him that today I approved the opening of an investigation of President Donald Trump,\" McCabe wrote. \"I explained that the purpose of the investigation was to investigate allegations of possible collusion between the president and the Russian government, possible obstruction of justice related to the firing of FBI Director James Corney, and possible conspiracy to obstruct justice.\"\\n\\nMCCABE DEMANDS DOJ STOP CRIMINALLY INVESTIGATING HIM FOR LEAKS\\n\\nWhen Rosenstein pushed for specifics, McCabe cited a disputed NBC News interview in which Trump emphasized that he was not firing Comey to obstruct any investigation, but also acknowledged that Comey\\'s handling of the Russia probe was on his mind at the time.\\n\\n\"Regarding the obstruction issues, I made clear that our predication was based not only on the president\\'s comments last week to reporter Lester Holt (that he conne¢ted the firing of the director to the FBl\\'s Russia investigation), but also on the several concerning comments the president made to Director Corney over the last few months,\" McCabe wrote.\\n\\nIn his interview with Holt, Trump stated, \"And in fact, when I decided to just do it [fire Comey], I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It’s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should’ve won.”\\n\\nHowever, conservative commentators argued that Trump\\'s comments to Holt were, in context, seemingly exculpatory. For example, Trump also told Holt that he was aware that firing Comey might \"even lengthen out the investigation, but I have to do the right thing for the American people. He’s the wrong man for that position.”\\n\\nTrump additionally explicitly rejected Holt\\'s suggestion that he was trying to send a message to future FBI directors that they should back off: “No, I’m not doing that. I think we have to get back to work. But I want to find out, I want to get to the bottom – if Russia hacked, if Russia did anything having to do with our election, I want to know about it.\"\\n\\nMcCabe did not mention either of those Trump statements in his memo.\\n\\nResponding to the claim that Rosenstein may have sought to wear a wire, Trump told Fox News earlier this year that he had his doubts.\\n\\n\"I\\'d much rather have you ask him that question,\" Trump said, referring to Rosenstein. \"It sounds a little bit far-fetched, frankly, but a lot of things in this case are far-fetched.\"\\n\\nRosenstein did not respond to multiple requests by Fox News for comment.\\n\\nIn the main, McCabe\\'s writings in the memo square with what he has said publicly about Holt\\'s interview with Trump, as well as Rosenstein\\'s actions. McCabe, speaking to CBS News\\' \"60 Minutes\" earlier this year, mentioned that Rosenstein was not joking when he floated the idea of wearing a wire to gather evidence, and had suggested Trump could be removed under the 25th Amendment.\\n\\nThe memo\\'s release comes as U.S. Attorney Jessie Liu earlier this month recommended moving forward with charges against McCabe. McCabe appealed the decision all the way up to Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who ultimately rejected that request.\\n\\nThe potential charges relate to DOJ inspector general findings against him regarding misleading statements concerning a Hillary Clinton-related investigation.\\n\\nA source close to McCabe’s legal team said they received an email from the Justice Department last week which said, “The department rejected your appeal of the United States Attorney’s Office’s decision in this matter. Any further inquiries should be directed to the United States Attorney’s Office.”\\n\\nMcCabe\\'s lawyers last week pushed for the criminal probe to end, calling it \"fatally flawed.\"\\n\\nMcCabe served at the FBI for 21 years. He became the acting director in May 2017 after Trump fired Comey.\\n\\nFormer Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe in March 2018 after the inspector general found he had repeatedly misstated his involvement in a leak to The Wall Street Journal regarding an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation.\\n\\nThe IG report faulted McCabe for leaking information to then-Wall Street Journal reporter Devlin Barrett for an Oct. 30, 2016, story titled “FBI in Internal Feud Over Hillary Clinton Probe.” The story -- written just days before the presidential election – focused on the FBI announcing the reopening of the Clinton investigation after finding thousands of her emails on a laptop belonging to former Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner, who was married to Clinton aide Huma Abedin.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nThe Journal\\'s account of the call said a senior Justice Department official expressed displeasure to McCabe that FBI agents were still looking into the Clinton Foundation, and that McCabe had defended the agent\\'s authority to pursue the issue.\\n\\nThat leak confirmed the existence of the probe, the report said, which Comey had up to that point refused to do.\\n\\nThe report said that McCabe \"lacked candor\" in a conversation with Comey when he said he had not authorized the disclosure and didn\\'t know who had done so. The IG also found that he lacked candor when questioned by FBI agents on multiple occasions since that conversation.\\n\\nFox News\\' Catherine Herridge and Brooke Singman contributed to this report.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Beto O\\'Rourke’s hard-left turn on gun confiscation in the Democratic presidential primary may play well with liberal primary voters across the country – but the former congressman could also be hurting his political future in Texas should he someday choose to run statewide again.\\n\\nO’Rourke, who nearly won a Senate seat in Texas in 2018 against incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, declared in a primary debate earlier this month, \"Hell yes, we are going to take your AR-15.\"\\n\\nThat’s in contrast to what O’Rourke’s said in the 2018 race, when the Democrat sought to appeal to the gun-friendly state by repeatedly telling Texans, \"If you own an AR-15, keep it.\" (He also said during that race that he didn’t want more such weapons sold.)\\n\\nWOMAN WHO CONFRONTED O\\'ROURKE ON GUN CONFISCATION PLANS: \\'SHAME ON HIM\\' FOR EXPLOITING \\'OUR TRAGEDIES\\'\\n\\nIn the wake of multiple recent mass shootings, including in his hometown of El Paso, O\\'Rourke has proposed forcing AR-15 owners to turn in their guns through a mandatory buyback program.\\n\\nThe NRA says that Americans own over 15 million AR-15s, and that they are the most popular rifle in America for training and home defense.\\n\\nO\\'Rourke\\'s campaign is now selling T-shirts featuring his \"hell yes\" gun confiscation slogan.\\n\\nCruz mocked O\\'Rourke\\'s shift last week, noting that in 2018 he warned that O\\'Rourke wanted to \"take our guns,” yet fact-checker PolitiFact rated that claim “false.”\\n\\n\"PolitiFact — you non-partisan sexy thing you — so ... did you buy Beto’s shirt?\" Cruz joked on Twitter.\\n\\nTexas political activists assert that O’Rourke can\\'t win in Texas anymore with these positions.\\n\\n“O\\'Rourke\\'s ‘hell yes’ to gun confiscation demonstrates how little he knows about Texans and rifles,” said JoAnn Fleming, the executive director of Grassroots America, We the People PAC, a conservative group in Texas. “By shooting off his mouth, Beto managed to end his political career in Texas, while driving up rifle sales.”\\n\\nO’Rourke’s rhetoric on guns has not picked up much support from his former colleagues in Congress. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, who is negotiating with Senate Republicans on expanding background checks and possibly creating “red flag” laws, pushed back on the mandatory buyback idea.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know of any other Democrat who agrees with Beto O\\'Rourke,\" Schumer told reporters from upstate New York, according to the Times Union.\\n\\nBut O’Rourke hit back at Schumer in a fundraising email, pointing out that most Democrats nationally agree with him.\\n\\n“With respect to the minority leader, a recent Monmouth University poll found that nearly 70 percent of Democrats support Beto’s mandatory buyback of assault weapons,” O’Rourke’s fundraising email said.\\n\\nO\\'Rourke entered the Democratic race to great fanfare this year, but has struggled in the polls. Some Democrats have suggested he set his sights on a 2020 bid for the Senate, and not the White House.\\n\\nEven some liberal writers have acknowledged that O’Rourke’s gun policies could hurt him in Texas.\\n\\n“Beto is no longer a viable candidate for the Senate in Texas, thanks to his gun confiscation comment,” German Lopez, a writer for Vox, wrote on Twitter.\\n\\nFor his part, O’Rourke has been adamant that he no longer wants a Texas Senate seat, despite past pressure from some Texas Democrats and news outlets to drop his long-shot presidential bid and compete for Republican Sen. John Cornyn\\'s seat instead.\\n\\n“There have even been some who have suggested that I stay in Texas and run for Senate,” O’Rourke said in an August speech. “But that would not be good enough for this community.

       "  'text': 'A slew of key swing-district Democrats late Monday threw their support en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry, as The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal reported in the evening that President Trump personally ordered acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before he pressed the new Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\\n\\nThe rapid-fire declarations by the influential Democrats, after seemingly months of teetering on the brink, came just a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi strongly suggested she was now warming to the idea of impeaching the president. Speaking to Fox News, a House Democratic leadership aide confirmed that the Democratic caucus will meet Tuesday afternoon to discuss the Ukraine matter and how to proceed.\\n\\n\"The horse is out of the barn,\" said former Hillary Clinton pollster and strategist Geoff Garin. \"Saddle up.\"\\n\\nIn remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the aid money to Ukraine\\'s investigative actions. “No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said. He also called the Bidens\\' actions in Ukraine a \"disgrace,\" and added: “It’s very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?”\\n\\nJoe Biden has acknowledged that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board.\\n\\nTrump has long said he wants European countries to pay more for their own defense, and an administration official told the Journal that Trump\\'s actions on the call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July \"reflected the president’s concerns about how the U.S. is spending aid money and whether U.S. allies are adequately contributing.\"\\n\\nAnother official told the paper that the Trump administration internally maintained at the time that Ukraine\\'s corruption problems were a consideration in the aid decision. Trump\\'s decision to freeze Ukraine funding reportedly came more than a week before his call with Zelensky.\\n\\n\"The horse is out of the barn. Saddle up.\" — Geoff Garin\\n\\nFox News has not independently confirmed the reports, which rocked Capitol Hill even as Democrats insisted they were keeping the developments in perspective. While Democrats are set to meet Tuesday to discuss Ukraine and possible impeachment proceedings, the top House aide told Fox News that trade – not Ukraine – would headline Democrats\\' agenda at a separate planned caucus meeting Wednesday.\\n\\n\"The dominant focus of the caucus on Wednesday is trade,\" the aide told Fox News. \"A second caucus has been added to ensure adequate time for member discussion on the whistleblower matter and a number of other pressing matters on Tuesday afternoon.\"\\n\\nSomething of an impeachment inquiry dam broke late Monday, when seven centrist Democratic freshmen lawmakers who served in the military and national security announced in an op-ed that if Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens for political benefit, it\\'s impeachable. The lawmakers – Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia – come largely from swing districts where Trump is popular but voters split.\\n\\nThe Democrats wrote in The Washington Post they \"do not arrive at this conclusion lightly.\"\\n\\n“These allegations are stunning, both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent,\" the lawmakers said. “These new allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect. We must preserve the checks and balances envisioned by the Founders and restore the trust of the American people in our government. And that is what we intend to do.”\\n\\nLater in the night, Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz and Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell also endorsed an impeachment inquiry. Such an inquiry would not be an impeachment vote, but rather an investigative process that could quickly lead to actual impeachment.\\n\\n\"On behalf of the people who elected us, we must formalize and accelerate the impeachment process so that Congress, by exercising its responsibility under Article 1 of the Constitution, can provide some measure of accountability,\" Schatz said in a statement.\\n\\nThe flurry of moves brings to 154 the number of House Democrats who have signaled strong support for possible impeachment proceedings. (235 Democrats and 198 Republicans are in the House, with one independent -- and a majority would be required to successfully impeach the president. An unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would be needed to convict and remove the president.)\\n\\nDemocrats have presented conflicting views, in court and in public, as to whether impeachment proceedings are already in progress. The renewed push on Monday could galvanize remaining Democrats to openly call their efforts an impeachment probe.\\n\\nFLASHBACK: IN APRIL, TRUMP SAYS HILLARY-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS \\'BIG,\\' WILL BE INVESTIGATED\\n\\nMeanwhile, a report in Politico late Monday suggested that Democrats may vote on a resolution to condemn Trump for allegedly pressuring Ukraine\\'s leadership to investigate possible corruption by Joe Biden\\'s son Hunter relating to his business dealings in the country.\\n\\nAnd The Washington Post reported in the evening that Pelosi was sounding out members of the Democratic caucus to see if the time has come to impeach the president.\\n\\nHowever, earlier Monday, a person familiar with the situation told Fox News that the whistleblower in question did not have \"firsthand knowledge\" of Trump\\'s conversation with Zelensky.\\n\\nThe source said that it was made clear in the complaint itself that the whistleblower did not have direct knowledge of the July phone call.\\n\\nFox News has learned that typically, multiple U.S. officials would be on such calls with the president, but this would indicate the whistleblower was not one of those people. It\\'s unclear if the individual read a transcript of the call, heard about it in conversation, or learned of it another way.\\n\\nSOURCE TO FOX NEWS: WHISTLEBLOWER HAD NO FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE OF TRUMP CALL\\n\\nNevertheless, Democrats have pressed forward on the issue, even as it risked backfiring by exposing potential wrongdoing by the former vice president.\\n\\n\"The Senate Republican \\'see no evil, hear no evil\\' attitude is unacceptable and must change,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Senate floor Monday. \"This again is an issue of solemn obligation. There is no wiggle room here, none.\"\\n\\nThe New York Democrat earlier in the day wrote a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell asking him to issue a subpoena and hold hearings over the complaint.\\n\\nIn a floor speech Monday afternoon, the Kentucky Republican rebuffed those calls from Democrats, saying the Senate Intelligence Committee has been following an established process and was working to hear from the intelligence community\\'s inspector general this week.\\n\\n\"It is regrettable that House Intelligence Committee Chairman [Adam] Schiff and Sen. Schumer have chosen to politicize the issue,\" McConnell said, calling for looking into the matter in an \"appropriate, deliberate bipartisan manner.\"\\n\\nAt least one Republican lawmaker has also called for the release of the transcript of Trump\\'s call.\\n\\n\"At this stage, given the seriousness of the allegations, it’s very important that the transcript and potentially as well the whistleblower come forward,\" said Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, an occasional Trump critic and onetime presidential rival.\\n\\nUKRAINE CONTROVERSY BOILS OVER ON SENATE FLOOR\\n\\nMeanwhile, top Republicans including California Rep. Devin Nunes predicted in interviews with Fox News that the gambit would backfire for Democrats.\\n\\nAnd in an exclusive interview with Fox News\\' \"Hannity\" on Monday, Vice President Mike Pence said Democrats\\' accusations were about to boomerang.\\n\\n\"The ironic thing is is that everything that our critics in the media are leveling at the president from this phone call, and leveling at our administration, everything that Democrats on Capitol Hill are running off and describing -- Vice President Joe Biden bragged about -- which was a quid-pro-quo -- withholding American aid in exchange for a specific action,\" Pence claimed.\\n\\nLate Sunday evening, Trump sounded a similar note, tweeting the \"real story\" was that \"Sleepy Joe Biden\" had \"forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son\\'s company by the threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine.\"\\n\\nIndeed, the whistleblower\\'s allegation could prompt scrutiny of the Obama administration\\'s Ukraine policy. The former vice president has explained on camera that in March 2016, he privately threatened then-President Petro Poroshenko that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if its top prosecutor was not fired. The prosecutor, at the time, was investigating possible corruption involving a natural gas firm with close ties to Hunter Biden.\\n\\n\"I said, \\'You\\'re not getting the billion,\\'\" Biden recounted telling Poroshenko at a Council on Foreign Relations event. \"I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: \\'I\\'m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,\" Biden continued, after assuring Poroshenko that Obama knew about the arrangement. \"And, they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\"\\n\\nIt remained unclear if this was directly tied to the prosecutor\\'s probe into the company linked to Hunter Biden, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well.\\n\\nAnd earlier this year, The Hill reported that the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, under the Obama administration, took the unusual step of pressuring prosecutors there to drop a probe into a group closely linked to liberal megadonor George Soros.\\n\\nAt the same time, Trump acknowledged Sunday that he had communicated with Zelensky about Biden, and that the conversation concerned \"the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don\\'t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son [contributing] to the corruption already in the Ukraine.\"\\n\\nThe president and top officials maintained Sunday that nothing inappropriate occurred on the call.\\n\\nThe whistleblower drama kicked into gear after The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump repeatedly had asked Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden.\\n\\nActing Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire is expected to testify before the House Intelligence Committee at an open hearing on Thursday. Democrats have sought the full whistleblower complaint and testimony from the whistleblower.\\n\\nBut Maguire has refused to share that information, citing presidential privilege.\\n\\n\"If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,\" Pelosi, D-Calif., warned Sunday. \"Thank you for your patriotism.\"\\n\\nPelosi went on: \"We must be sure that the President and his Administration are always conducting our national security and foreign policy in the best interest of the American people, not the President’s personal or political interest.\"\\n\\nSpeaking to CNN\\'s \"State of the Union,\" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., also said impeachment was on the table. Schiff previously has claimed to have hard evidence that the Trump team improperly colluded with Russia.\\n\\n\"Why doesn’t the president just say, \\'Release the whistleblower complaint.\\' Clearly he’s afraid for the public to see,\" Schiff said. \"This would be the most profound violation of the presidential oath of office, certainly during this presidency, which says a lot, but perhaps during any presidency. There is no privilege that covers corruption. There is no privilege to engage in underhanded discussions.\"\\n\\nThe top Democrats\\' rhetoric came soon after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Saturday night kickstarted a dormant, but long-simmering and occasionally explosive feud with top House Democrats in the form of a fiery tweet: \"At this point, the bigger national scandal isn’t the president’s lawbreaking behavior - it is the Democratic Party’s refusal to impeach him for it.\"\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nPelosi and Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., appeared to reach a truce of sorts after a closed-door meeting in July, in which both sought to ease infighting that some Democrats viewed as counterproductive. That meeting came shortly before the departure of Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti.\\n\\nFox News\\' Alex Pappas, Jake Gibson, and The Associated Press contributed to this report.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The Democratic National Committee’s raising the bar for presidential candidates to qualify for November’s fifth-round primary debate.\\n\\nBut, the upping of polling and donor thresholds – more modest than the doubling of the criteria from July’s second round to this month’s third round – may not significantly winnow the field of White House contenders still standing after October’s debate.\\n\\nThe DNC announced on Monday that to qualify for the November showdown, candidates must reach at least 3 percent in four approved national or early-voting-state polls. That’s up from the 2 percent needed to reach the stage at the September and October debates and up from the 1 percent needed in three approved surveys for the June and July debates.\\n\\nOCTOBER DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY DEBATE TO BE HELD IN OHIO\\n\\nBut, to tamper down any criticism from the early voting states, the DNC added another way to satisfy the polling criteria – reaching 5 percent in two qualifying surveys in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina – the first four states to vote in the nominating calendar.\\n\\nThe window for the polling is from Sept. 13 to seven days before the still-unannounced November debate. In previous debates, candidates had until two weeks before the showdown to reach the polling criteria.\\n\\n\"Qualification period ends 1 week (not 2 weeks) before the debate, giving candidates more time to qualify,\" DNC communications director Xochitl Hinojosa tweeted.\\n\\nThe other threshold – fundraising – also saw a slight raising of the bar. To make the cut, candidates will have to receive campaign contributions from 165,000 individual donors. That’s up from 130,000 for the September and October debates and from 65,000 for the first two rounds of showdowns. Candidates also will have to receive 600 unique contributions from each of 20 states, the District of Columbia or U.S. territories.\\n\\nThe DNC’s faced criticism over its thresholds for months from many of the lower and middle-tier candidates, who argued that the criteria forced them to concentrate on boosting donor contributions at the expense of retail politicking in the early voting states. And, some activists and party leaders in the early voting states have also criticized the DNC for winnowing the record field of candidates – which topped off at roughly two-dozen contenders this summer – before voters actually got to vote in the primaries and caucuses starting this coming February.\\n\\n\"The DNC is using polling to winnow the field even further, when it\\'s voters and caucus-goers who should be determining our nominee,\" said Shannon Beckham, a spokeswoman for Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet\\'s presidential campaign.\\n\\nAnd, Galia Slayen, a spokeswoman for Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, told Fox News that \"as the DNC continues to make the rules up as they go along, Governor Bullock will remain focused on bringing his message of a fair shot for every American directly to voters on the ground.\"\\n\\nBoth Bennet and Bullock were on the debate stage in July for the third round but failed to qualify for this month\\'s showdown and it appears unlikely either will make the cut for October\\'s debate.\\n\\nThe new thresholds shouldn’t be much of a problem for many of the leading contenders – such as former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Kamala Harris of California, as well as South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\\n\\n2020 DEMOCRATS FUME AT DNC OVER DEBATE THRESHOLDS\\n\\nSome of the other six candidates likely to make the October debate are not sure bets to qualify for November’s showdown. That group consists of Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Rep. Beto O\\'Rourke of Texas and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.\\n\\nAs he has in the past, Yang praised the DNC, tweeting, \"Kudos to the DNC for raising the thresholds in a fair and transparent manner as well.\"\\n\\nSome of the candidates, including Booker and Buttigieg, quickly used news of the new thresholds to reach out to supporters with fundraising emails.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro and billionaire philanthropist and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer – who\\'ve also made the cut for October’s showdown – have yet to hit 3 percent in any polls since the November qualifying period kicked off earlier this month. And, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who\\'s just one poll away from making the October debate, also has yet to reach 3 percent in any approved surveys.\\n\\nA new qualifying poll – a Monmouth University survey in New Hampshire – is set for release on Tuesday.',\n",

       "  'text': \"COLSTRIP, Mont. – This city, with its massive coal-fired power plant and rich coal mine next to it, is definitely Trump Country. As a candidate, Donald Trump repeatedly promised a coal revival.\\n\\nBut since he took office, U.S. coal consumption has hit a 41-year low and coal plant closures have actually accelerated. The next to fall, in December, will be Colstrip units 1 and 2, which have been keeping the lights on throughout the Pacific Northwest since 1975. Shutting down one-third of the capacity of the largest coal plant west of the Mississippi comes even after Trump scrapped the Obama-era Clean Power Plan and his administration pledged $39 million to make coal plants run cleaner.\\n\\n“There’s nothing he can do about it,” said Randy Hardy, an energy consultant and former head of the Bonneville Power Administration. “The market economics are so compelling that absent massive federal government subsidies to keep coal alive, you couldn’t do it economically.”\\n\\nCOAL MINERS' STRUGGLE CONTINUES AMID TRUMP PROMISES, DEMOCRATIC PLANS\\n\\nCheap natural gas from fracking is making coal less competitive, along with falling prices for wind and solar power. Puget Sound Energy, a major utility in Washington state and co-owner of the Colstrip plant, is rapidly moving away from coal power, which currently makes up 38 percent of its electricity portfolio.\\n\\n“It’s driven off of economics,” said Ron Roberts, PSE’s director of generation. “It’s just going to become more and more expensive to run a coal-fired power plant.”\\n\\nTalen Energy owns 50 percent of Colstrip 1 and 2. In a statement, Talen President Dale Lebsack said the decision to close the units “comes after extensive review and exhaustive efforts over the last few years to address the financial challenges that these units face.”\\n\\nClimate politics are also killing coal and driving down future demand. Washington state passed a law that its utilities must be coal-free by 2025. The state’s lone coal plant in Centralia will begin phasing out production in 2020.\\n\\nDANIEL TURNER: YES, THE WAR ON COAL IS REAL, BUT HURTING OUR ENERGY INDUSTRY NOW DOES NOT HELP THE FUTURE\\n\\nOregon’s last remaining coal plant in Boardman will completely shut down its 550 MW of generation by the end of 2020. Oregon’s utilities must be coal-free by 2035. Coal plant closures are also scheduled in Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada and Utah. In all, the amount of power produced by burning coal is expected to drop by more than half by 2030, from 34,000 MW to 16,000 MW.\\n\\nNancy Hirsch, executive director of the NW Energy Coalition, said the coal plant closures are necessary.\\n\\n“It’s a huge contributor to meeting climate goals and the Paris Accords,” said Hirsh, “that’s a critical piece to every country’s commitment to meeting those emissions reduction.”\\n\\nDOUGLAS MACKINNON: BLOOMBERG TO COAL WORKERS: YOU'RE FIRED\\n\\nBut in Colstrip, Montana, a city of 2,300 residents that started out in the 1920s as a coal camp to feed the railroads, there is only worry.\\n\\nThis tight-knit community with high incomes and safe streets is bracing for the potential loss of hundreds of jobs. The power plant, with its four units, employs 372 workers while the Rosebud mine, which feeds the plant, has 361 employees.\\n\\nEveryone in Colstrip is somehow connected to the coal industry. Many businesses have window signs touting “Coal Keeps the Lights On.” The sign welcoming visitors to Colstrip reads “Tomorrow’s Town Today.” But Joe Micheletti, chief operating officer of the Westmoreland Coal Company, sounds like a man resigned to mass layoffs and a very uncertain future for Colstrip and the miners who call it home.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n“They have served this country admirably for a long, long time,” Micheletti said, “and I don’t understand how we just want to kick them to the curb.”\\n\\nColstrip units 3 and 4 were built in 1982 and will continue to feed the power grid after units 1 and 2 shut down December 31. But with large utilities in Washington and Oregon steadily weaning their customers off of coal power, many energy analysts think the entire Colstrip plant will be shut down soon after 2025.\\n\\nIt’s a devastating thought to Montana state Sen. Duane Ankney, who represents Colstrip and used to work at the plant.\\n\\n“If there ain’t no 3 and 4, there ain’t no Colstrip, or very little of it,” said Ankney.\\n\\nAnkney said eliminating coal generation will lead to blackouts because renewables like wind and solar power are limited.\\n\\n“This is a matter of national security in the Northwest,” Ankney insists, “We have to have baseload power.”\\n\\nJohn Williams, the mayor of Colstrip, just released a lengthy report on the city’s future. It talks about diversification and tourism. But the reality is Colstrip needs coal jobs to survive. Nearly all of the city’s general fund is supplied by coal industry taxes paid. Williams pleads his case that burning coal is not destroying the environment.\\n\\n“The coal is here because of what was occurring 30 million years ago,” said Williams, “The climate was different 30 million years ago. The climate will be different 50 years from now, 100 years from now.”\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C., is a “federal enclave” carved out of Maryland and Virginia, an odd political subdivision – and the drumbeat has grown to convert the city into a state.\\n\\nIt’s been a quarter-century since Congress last explored the idea of the nation’s capital entering the union as the 51st state. But, with Democrats back in control of the House, it’s a priority of many liberals, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. More than half of the House now supports awarding Washington statehood. The House Oversight Committee recently convened a hearing to explore the possibility of creating a new state for the first time in 60 years.\\n\\nLet’s start with the name.\\n\\nEvery state gets two statues inside the U.S. Capitol. But, since it’s not a state, the District of Columbia gets only one – and that honor came just a few years ago. A statue of abolitionist Frederick Douglass - who lived in Washington – greets tourists in the U.S. Capitol Visitor’s Center. And, if D.C. ever becomes a state, the plan is to name it after Douglass. Think “WDC,” just as you would now. The city would become “Washington Douglass Commonwealth.”\\n\\nMany liberals support statehood for D.C. – especially members of “the Squad,” who often focus on what they see as political injustices.\\n\\nAn image campaign is already underway. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., said last week at a hearing that she’ll fly an American flag bearing 51 stars outside her Capitol Hill office.\\n\\n“To deny the statehood of the District of Columbia is to deny the impact of slavery in America,” said Rep. Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., at the hearing.\\n\\nWhat Ocasio-Cortez referenced was the District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act. Congress approved a measure and President Abraham Lincoln signed into law a plan to emancipate slaves in Washington on April 16, 1862. This was a few months before Lincoln crafted the Emancipation Proclamation. Many slaves came to Washington to escape slavery.\\n\\nBut, most Republicans have opposed making D.C. a state.\\n\\n“Congress cannot admit D.C. legislatively,” said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. “If you want to change it, its remedy means amending the Constitution of the United States.”\\n\\nJordan said the geographic dimensions of the District of Columbia were spelled out in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. It specifically outlined a federal district “not exceeding ten Miles square” to serve as “the Seat of Government of the United States.”\\n\\nThe founders cut up the District of Columbia from parts of Maryland and Virginia, the Potomac River snaking through the middle. Over time, people flocked to the District of Columbia. One part was even known as “Washington City.”\\n\\nTLAIB VOWS TO DISPLAY ALTERED AMERICAN FLAG WITH 51 STARS IN SUPPORT OF DC STATEHOOD\\n\\nIt was thought that the hamlets of Georgetown and Alexandria, Va., would function as independent communities inside the District of Columbia. Alexandria prospered because it was a port and the Potomac became unnavigable north of there. The federal government retroceded the Virginia portion of the District of Columbia to the Commonwealth in 1848. Most of the “Virginia” section of D.C. is now comprised of Old Town Alexandria and Arlington County, Va. Stone markers have continued to dot the old boundaries of D.C. in Virginia. One such location is in a church parking lot off of King Street -- the main thoroughfare in Alexandria -- and another, close to the King Street Metro Station in Old Town.\\n\\nBut, here’s the heart of the problem for the District of Columbia: It has no vote on the House floor and no senators. It’s not a state, so it can’t.\\n\\nNon-voting Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat, has represented the city in the House since 1991. But, as a “delegate” to Congress, Norton has been barred from voting on the House floor. House Democrats have allowed non-voting delegates such as Norton and other similar members from Guam and Puerto Rico to vote in a special, parliamentary construct known as “The Committee of the Whole,” but it’s not quite the same. Norton can serve on committees and introduce bills. She has an office on Capitol Hill. But, there is no vote for D.C.\\n\\nThe Senate hasn’t officially recognized any such non-voting persons, even though D.C. has elected “shadow senators.”\\n\\nIn short, the city has had no vote in Congress, yet its residents have paid federal taxes.\\n\\n“For Washington, D.C., taxation without representation is more than just a catchy hashtag or bumper-sticker slogan,” Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., said at the hearing.\\n\\nIn the 1990s, the D.C. city council voted to plaster the phrase “taxation without representation” across the city’s license plates. Residents could opt out – including then-President Bill Clinton. The verbiage never appeared on the presidential limo. The other option for the plates was the anodyne “celebrate and discover.”\\n\\nThe political makeup of Washington, D.C., has been key to the statehood debate. Washington current has about 700,000 residents, making it more populous than Vermont or Wyoming. Every state scores at least one House member. But, the new state would receive two senators - the same as California or Texas. And, due to the city’s progressive leanings, it’s almost a foregone conclusion that the senators would be Democrats. The lack of balance has concerned Republicans.\\n\\nWorld War II, the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Cold War, the geostrategic importance of both Alaska and Hawaii and oil reserves in the former accelerated the push for statehood in the 49th and 50th states.\\n\\nThe U.S. admitted Alaska in January 1959. Hawaii joined in August 1959. Many Hawaiians thought at the time that it would become the 49th state, not Alaska. There was a prominent record label in Hawaii called “49th State” which marketed luau music. But, statehood hinged on two powerful people: Senate Majority Leader and future President Lyndon Johnson, D-Texas, and House Speaker Sam Rayburn, D-Texas. They worked to pair the admission of Alaska with the admission of Hawaii, just months apart.\\n\\nIt was a compromise, with the expectation that one state would lean toward the Democrats with the other leaning toward the Republicans. But, something strange happened. Back in the late 1950s, Alaska was supposed to be the blue state and Hawaii the red state. In modern days, Alaska has been more conservative and Hawaii more liberal – although both have had governors, senators and representatives of the other party, even in recent years.\\n\\nStill, the compromise worked.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nThe Alaska-Hawaii experience would be worth noting. At this point, there has been no “offset” to D.C.’s liberal political base. Even statehood for Puerto Rico would likely result in an influx of Democrats to Capitol Hill. No other “candidate” territory is seen as conservative.\\n\\nPolitics is all about compromise. As a result, the lack of political balance likely poses the biggest impediment to D.C. statehood.',\n",

       "  'text': 'President Trump on Monday slammed Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O’Rourke for his controversial comment from a recent debate about confiscating semi-automatic weapons – arguing that statements like the one made by the former Texas representative make it tougher for Dems to achieve any meaningful legislation regarding firearms.\\n\\n“I saw this character from Texas,” Trump said of O’Rourke following a meeting in New York with the South Korean president. “Can’t imagine he\\'ll get one vote.”\\n\\nTrump added: “When Beto starts talking about confiscating guns, it makes it much tougher.

A summer of carnage was marked by shootings in Gilroy, Calif.; El Paso, Texas; and Dayton, Ohio; and over a 10-mile stretch between Midland and Odessa, Texas. In all, more than 40 people were killed and about 100 were wounded in the attacks.\\n\\nBesides stirring up concerns among Second Amendment supporters, O’Rourke’s comment has also been seen by some political observers as hurting his future in Texas, should he choose to run statewide again.\\n\\nTexas political activists assert that O’Rourke can\\'t win in Texas anymore with these positions.\\n\\n“O\\'Rourke\\'s ‘hell yes’ to gun confiscation demonstrates how little he knows about Texans and rifles,” said JoAnn Fleming, the executive director of Grassroots America, We the People PAC, a conservative group in Texas. “By shooting off his mouth, Beto managed to end his political career in Texas, while driving up rifle sales.”\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nFox News\\' Maxim Lott and The Associated Press contributed to this report.',\n",

       "  'text': 'President Trump, speaking Monday at a United Nations event on religious freedom, called out world leaders for espousing diversity and inclusion while “shunning or silencing” people of faith.\\n\\n“Too often people in power preach diversity, while shunning or silencing the faithful,” Trump said. “True tolerance means respecting the rights of all people to express their deeply held religious beliefs.”\\n\\nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION REVOKES CALIFORNIA\\'S AUTHORITY TO SET AUTO MILEAGE STANDARDS\\n\\nWhile Trump did not specifically call out individual nations, Vice President Pence -- who spoke before the president -- criticized several countries for attacks on religious freedom, including China\\'s persecution of ethnic Uyghur Muslims, Venezuela\\'s contested leader Nicolás Maduro\\'s anti-Semitic rhetoric and Iran\\'s oppression of Christians, Jews and Sunni Muslims.\\n\\nTrump -- who was joined on stage by Pence, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other world leaders -- also announced that his administration was allocating an additional $25 million to protect religious freedom as well as religious sites and relics, and launching an initiative with business leaders to protect religious freedom in the workplace.\\n\\n“This institution will engage the private sector to protect people of all faiths in the workplace,” he said.\\n\\nTrump has made religious freedom one of the hallmarks of his administration and his push for greater protections to religious groups helped him win the evangelical Christian vote – and ultimately the White House – in 2016.\\n\\nPastors praised Trump\\'s attention to the issue Monday.\\n\\n\"This is the first time any leader of a nation has addressed the U.N. on religious persecution,\" Robert Jeffress told \"Fox & Friends\" host Ainsley Earhardt.\\n\\nDuring his speech on Monday, the president touted his administration’s work in securing the release of Pastor Andrew Brunson, who was imprisoned in Turkey for over two years. Brunson was in attendance on Monday at the event.\\n\\nThe president, however, has also faced accusations of hypocrisy on the religious freedom issue, regarding policies toward Muslims. Trump was roundly criticized for an executive order he signed just days after taking office in 2017 that banned entry into the United States for 90 days of nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries, banned the entry of all refugees for 120 days, and indefinitely banned the entry of all Syrian refugees.\\n\\nThe so-called “Muslim ban” faced numerous legal challenges and a version of it was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court in June 2018 after a mechanism was added for nationals from the banned countries to enter the U.S. by obtaining a waiver.\\n\\n“The Proclamation is expressly premised on legitimate purposes: preventing entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their practices,” Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority. “The text says nothing about religion.”\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nThe president’s speech on religious freedom this week also drew controversy when it was reported that he was skipping a U.N. event on climate change to make his speech.\\n\\nTrump, however, did make a brief stop at the U.N. Climate Action Summit on Monday, where he sat next to Vice President Pence as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was on stage and stayed through German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s speech.

       "  'authors': ['Dana Bash', 'Manu Raju', 'Sunlen Serfaty', 'Clare Foran'],\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington (CNN) House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday announced a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, a dramatic and historic move that comes as the President faces outrage over reports that he pressured a foreign leader in an effort to target a political rival.\\n\\nThe announcement marks the most direct step taken by the House Democratic leader to embrace impeachment proceedings and is a significant escalation in the fight between House Democrats and the President.\\n\\n\"Today, I am announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry,\" Pelosi said in a brief speech in the Capitol, adding, \"The President must be held accountable. No one is above the law.\"\\n\\n\"Actions taken to date by the President have seriously violated the Constitution,\" the House speaker said.\\n\\nThe House speaker, who has long pushed to keep her caucus away from the politically divisive issue, is responding to the seismic shift among Democratic members, following Trump\\'s admission of discussing Vice President Joe Biden and his son in his phone call with the Ukrainian President. Dozens of House Democrats -- many from moderate or Trump-won districts -- have announced their support for an impeachment inquiry over the past 48 hours.\\n\\n\"This week, the President has admitted to asking the President of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically. The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the President\\'s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,\" Pelosi said in her public remarks.\\n\\nIn advance of that statement, Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer also announced plans to vote on a resolution of disapproval on Wednesday for allegations \"that the President of the United States sought to enlist a foreign government to interfere in our democratic process by investigating one of his political rivals -- and may have used the withholding of Congressionally-appropriated foreign assistance days earlier as intimidation.\" Their statement did not mention impeachment.\\n\\n\\'Full speed ahead\\'\\n\\nPelosi consulted Tuesday afternoon with the six House Democratic leaders to discuss their presentation to the caucus later in the day, Democratic sources familiar with the issue said. In that closed-door meeting before her public announcement, Pelosi said the six chairmen will continue to investigate under a powerful new umbrella of an impeachment inquiry.\\n\\nA separate source in the room said the speaker added, \"Here we are. A moment of truth. Truth is what this has been about all along.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s taken it to another level of betrayal therefore we\\'re moving forward with another level of inquiry,\" Pelosi said.\\n\\nBehind the scenes, Pelosi has encouraged members of her caucus to state their impeachment position now in order to show there is a groundswell in the caucus. She is also conveying that message to freshmen.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Pelosi also told the caucus that the impeachment inquiry will be done \"expeditiously,\" but wasn\\'t specific in her timeframe, according to a source in the room.\\n\\nRep. Jackie Speier told CNN that the President\\'s actions in regards to Ukraine were so egregious, that there has been a \"dramatic\" shift by Pelosi.\\n\\n\"I think she\\'s very laser-focused on this offense as being so egregious that it warrants a full blown impeachment inquiry,\" she said.\\n\\nAsked what the timeline is for this, she said, \"swiftly.\"\\n\\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said on Tuesday after Pelosi\\'s remarks, \"I only have one thing to say, full speed ahead.\"\\n\\nTide changing for Pelosi allies and vulnerable House freshmen\\n\\nCivil rights icon Rep. John Lewis on Tuesday announced his support for impeachment proceedings, arguing that \"now is the time to act\" and any delay \"would betray the foundation of our democracy.\"\\n\\n\"We will never find the truth unless we use the power given to the House of Representatives and the House alone to begin an official investigation as dictated by the Constitution,\" the Georgia Democrat said in a speech on the House floor . \"The future of our democracy is at stake.\"\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Rep. Lewis joins Dems calling for impeachment inquiry Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Rep. Lewis joins Dems calling for impeachment inquiry 01:04\\n\\nSome of Pelosi\\'s closest allies, including House Reps. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and Debbie Dingell of Michigan, have signaled their support for impeachment proceedings — a significant indicator that the speaker could be moving closer to backing the divisive political procedure.\\n\\nAnother crucial development has been multiple high profile freshmen Democrats in districts Trump won in 2016 either coming out publicly to fully endorse the House Judiciary Committee\\'s impeachment inquiry or at least opening the door to proceedings , citing Trump\\'s actions as forcing them to act.\\n\\nOne of those freshman Democrats, Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, stressed on CNN \"New Day\" Tuesday that \"none of us ran on impeaching the President.\" But she argued that the allegation that Trump might have tried leveraging foreign military aid to advance his reelection efforts was \"just a line that I think was too much for all of us.\"\\n\\nPelosi has cited the House members in GOP-leaning districts as part of her hesitance to embrace impeachment, and the groundswell of statements over the past 48 hours could signal a tipping point in the political calculus.\\n\\n\"If investigations confirm recent reports, these actions represent impeachable offences that threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections and jeopardize the balance of power within the federal government,\" Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan said in a statement Tuesday. Stevens had told CNN last month that she had \"mixed reviews from the people of my district\" on the issue of whether to move forward with impeachment proceedings.\\n\\nSo far, as many as 165 House Democrats have publicly stated their support for an impeachment inquiry into Trump, according to a CNN count, and that doesn\\'t include the House Democrats who\\'ve said in recent days that the President\\'s behavior is a turning point in Democrats\\' oversight into the administration.\\n\\nPelosi has, for months, resisted pursuing impeachment because she has sought to protect vulnerable Democrats in GOP-leaning districts who could face voter backlash.\\n\\nRep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a member of House Judiciary, told CNN on Tuesday morning that he believes articles of impeachment are \"inevitable\" and said there\\'s a \"growing clamor throughout the Democratic caucus\" to deal with Trump\\'s \"reckless and lawless\" behavior.\\n\\nSome holdouts remain\\n\\nBut some vulnerable Democrats in 2020 are still treading cautiously on the issue.\\n\\nRep. Ben McAdams of Utah told CNN on Tuesday that he\\'s \"considering\" impeachment, but didn\\'t want to discuss the issue further.\\n\\n\"Before making any judgments, I want to know the facts of what occurred between the President and Ukraine,\" McAdams said. \"I share Sen. (Mitt) Romney\\'s view that If the President used his position to pressure a foreign power to dig up dirt on a rival for his own personal gain, it would be deeply troubling. I believe it would be a betrayal of the loyalty owed to our country and the Constitution.\"\\n\\nRep. Max Rose, another endangered House Democrat, told CNN that he has not moved off his opposition to impeachment, but argued that \"we have to get to the facts\" of the allegations.\\n\\n\"It is impossible to not take these allegations seriously. It is a national security matter,\" the New York Democrat said Tuesday on Capitol Hill, adding, \"It\\'s incredibly serious ... what I\\'m not going to do is jump to make another declaration.\"\\n\\nAsked if that meant he is opposed to moving ahead on impeachment, Rose said, \"My current position right now is clear, but that is not a justification to not take these points as seriously as possible.\"\\n\\nRep. Susan Wild stood up during the Democratic caucus meeting on Tuesday and argued that Pelosi should cancel some of the upcoming two week recess to not lose momentum, according to a source in the room.\\n\\nThe House, at the end of the week, will recess for two weeks for a district work period over the Yom Kippur and Columbus Day holidays.\\n\\nCNN previously reported that Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden\\'s son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation.\\n\\nThere has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.\\n\\nThat call was also part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, which hasn\\'t been shared with lawmakers despite calls from Democrats.\\n\\nTrump acknowledged on Sunday that he discussed the former Vice President Joe Biden in a phone call over the summer with Ukraine\\'s president, but denied doing anything improper.\\n\\nCNN confirmed that Trump asked his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to put a hold on millions in military aid to Ukraine roughly one week before a call with Zelensky, two senior administration officials said on Monday. The Washington Post first reported this.\\n\\nIn her public remarks on Tuesday, Pelosi said, \"The law is unequivocal: it says the DNI, director of national intelligence, shall provide congress the full whistleblower complaint,\" Pelosi said.\\n\\nEarlier this month, the House Judiciary Committee approved a resolution defining the rules of the panel\\'s impeachment investigation. That vote came, however, as Democrats struggled to publicly define the committee probe with Nadler saying the committee is conducting an impeachment inquiry, while Pelosi and other Democratic leaders had refrained from calling it that.\\n\\nIn a nod to the ongoing investigations in the House, Pelosi said on Tuesday, \"For the past several months we have been investigating in our committees and litigating in the courts so that the House can gather all the relevant facts and consider whether to exercise its full Article I powers, including a constitutional power of the utmost gravity, approval of articles of impeachment.\"\\n\\nThe House Speaker also said in her speech, \"I can say with authority the Trump administration\\'s actions undermine both our national security and our intelligence and our protections of whistleblowers.\"\\n\\nThis story is breaking and will be updated.',\n",

       "  'text': '(CNN) House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took the momentous step of formally opening an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump on a day of stunning and breakneck developments in the Ukraine scandal.\\n\\nThe White House is making its own moves, making public a key telephone transcript and preparing to release to Congress a whistleblower\\'s report as early as Wednesday, according to two sources familiar. Politico first reported the White House\\'s intention . One source told CNN the whistleblower report is under review and going through declassification and could be released within hours of the transcript release.\\n\\nThe investigation will test accusations that Trump sought to pressure a foreign power -- Ukraine -- into effectively intervening in the 2020 election to damage one of his possible Democratic opponents, former Vice President Joe Biden.\\n\\n\"The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the President\\'s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,\" Pelosi said in a news conference. \"Therefore, today, I am announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.\"\\n\\nTrump lamented the news in that it took the focus off his trip the United Nations General Assembly.\\n\\n\"Such an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage. So bad for our Country!\" the President.\\n\\nHer decision elevates the turmoil and division whipped up by Trump\\'s two-and-half years in power to historic proportions with massive political stakes for the 2020 election and beyond.\\n\\nPelosi, after months of trying to slow walk impeachment demands from her liberal base, elected to strike, despite the President agreeing to release a transcript on Wednesday of a call with Ukraine\\'s President. Trump says the document will clear him of wrongdoing despite his public admission that he pressured Ukraine to open an investigation into Biden and his son -- a fact in itself that his opponents argue is a gross abuse of power.\\n\\nThere is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.\\n\\nOnly two Presidents were impeached in the first 223 years of US history -- Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. Now there is the possibility it could happen twice in the last 20 years, reflecting the fractured state of a nation split down the middle that has been further polarized by Trump\\'s presidency.\\n\\nAn impeachment inquiry would be the ultimate showdown between House Democrats who believe they were handed power in the midterm elections to constrain Trump, and a presidency that has repeatedly ripped democratic norms and tested the Constitution itself.\\n\\nUnfolding events\\n\\nTuesday\\'s developments unfolded at staggering speed in Washington and in New York where the President\\'s \"America First\" speech to the United General Assembly was overshadowed.\\n\\nTrump decided to release the transcript under fierce political pressure over claims, first triggered by a whistleblower\\'s complaint, that he threatened to withhold $400 million in military and security aid to force Kiev to open an investigation into his potential 2020 rival Biden and his son, Hunter.\\n\\nThere is no evidence to support claims -- made in public by Trump as recently as Tuesday morning -- that the Bidens had corrupt dealings with the former Soviet Republic.\\n\\nAt the United Nations, Trump put forward an alternative, retrospective justification for delaying aid to Ukraine ahead of his call to Zelensky on July 25.\\n\\nHe said he wanted to wait for European nations to contribute their fair share.\\n\\nLater, the President insisted in a tweet that his decision to provide the declassified, unredacted transcript -- opposed by senior aides -- would show that there was no quid pro quo offered to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\\n\\n\"You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!\" Trump tweeted.\\n\\nSome senior Democrats however insist that there need not be a quid pro quo for Trump to have committed a \"high crime and misdemeanor\" needed for a President to be impeached.\\n\\nThe simple fact of a President asking a foreign leader to investigate a domestic political opponent is seen by many legal and political commentators as an abuse of power.\\n\\nPelosi\\'s strategy\\n\\nIn an appearance in Washington, Pelosi warned: \"The President is making lawlessness a virtue in our country.\"\\n\\nThe House speaker did not specifically commit to an impeachment inquiry in the appearance and it\\'s possible that the facts of the case will not merit, eventually, a full House vote on the question.\\n\\nBut she shifted her position as a political torrent changed the shape of the impeachment debate in Washington. A number of moderate swing-state Democrats who she had been trying to protect, moved to the impeachment side of the argument.\\n\\nShe said that the nature of Trump\\'s alleged offense was clear -- a factor that might have changed the political equation.\\n\\n\"This is the most understandable by the public. And It\\'s really important to know this. There is no requirement there be a quid pro quo in the conversation,\" she said. \"You don\\'t ask foreign governments to help us in our election. That\\'s what we try to stop with Russia. It\\'s wrong.\"\\n\\nPelosi told her caucus that the impeachment would center around six House committees already investigating the President. It would be up to the Judiciary Committee eventually to decide whether to advance Articles of Impeachment. If the full House votes by simple majority to impeach a President his trial then takes place in the Senate.\\n\\nThere is so far no suggestion, however, that staunch Republican support for Trump in the GOP controlled chamber is waning. That means the two-thirds majority that would be needed to convict the president on Articles of Impeachment and to oust him from office looks at this point unlikely to materialize.\\n\\nLike Pelosi, Biden also seems to be calculating his political position. As the subject of Trump\\'s attacks and the Democratic front runner, he is in a unique position in the cascading drama.\\n\\nIn an on camera appearance apparently meant to project presidential gravitas and temperament, the former vice president said that if Trump failed to provide information about the case, he would leave lawmakers with no choice.\\n\\n\"Denying Congress the information, which it is constitutionally entitled to, and obstructing its efforts to investigate actions is not the conduct of an American president. It\\'s an abuse of power,\" Biden said.\\n\\n\"Donald Trump will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment. That would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making,\" Biden said.\\n\\nObstacles\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Joe Biden: If Trump doesn\\'t comply, Congress must impeach Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Joe Biden: If Trump doesn\\'t comply, Congress must impeach 02:11\\n\\nDemocratic reluctance to move ahead with impeachment, despite what many in the party see as gross abuses of power revealed by special counsel Robert Mueller, has partly been based on fears of igniting Trump\\'s base and causing a 2020 political backlash.\\n\\nImpeachment -- that can result in a democratic election being overturned -- is the most serious and consequential political maneuver available under the Constitution. It would tear at the fabric of the nation and trigger incalculable results and political forces that could reverberate for years.\\n\\nIn another potentially enormous development, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff announced that the whistleblower who filed the complaint about Trump\\'s conduct, wants to speak to the committee.\\n\\nThe whistleblower has requested guidance from acting DNI Joseph Maguire on how to do so, Schiff said. Maguire had been under pressure from the White House and Justice Department not to turn over the whistleblower\\'s complaint, but that appeared to change late Tuesday, so it was not clear how realistic are Democratic hopes of hearing the testimony.\\n\\nTrump made the decision to release the whistleblower complaint on Tuesday, a source familiar told CNN. It\\'s unclear what is behind his change in position, though Pelosi told lawmakers she pressed Trump during a Tuesday phone call to release the complaint.\\n\\nTwo White House officials downplayed expectations for any bombshell revelation in the call transcript, saying it is expected to be \"underwhelming.\"\\n\\nOne of the officials conceded that makes the release of the whistleblower complaint that much more important. But the official raised questions about the credibility of the the administration employee who filed the complaint about Trump\\'s interactions with the Ukrainian President, referring to the employee as \"the so-called whistleblower.\"',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington (CNN) House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff announced Tuesday that the whistleblower who filed a mysterious complaint, which includes allegations about President Donald Trump\\'s conduct, would like to speak to the committee.\\n\\nThe whistleblower has requested guidance from acting DNI Joseph Maguire on how to do so, Schiff said.\\n\\n\"We have been informed by the whistleblower\\'s counsel that their client would like to speak to our committee and has requested guidance from the Acting DNI as to how to do so,\" Schiff tweeted.\\n\\n\"We\\'re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower\\'s testimony as soon as this week,\" he added.\\n\\nThe whistleblower\\'s legal counsel did not immediately respond to CNN\\'s request for comment.\\n\\nAsked about Schiff\\'s comments, an ODNI spokesperson told CNN: \"ODNI continues to work with the Administration and Congress to accommodate Congressional requests regarding the whistleblower complaint. We are aware of recent developments the news media reported this afternoon, and appreciate your interest in this evolving matter.\"\\n\\n\"Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire will appear in an open session before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Thursday, Sept. 26. Updates on ADNI Maguire\\'s testimony or other matters within ODNI\\'s purview will be provided as they become available,\" the statement said.\\n\\nThe news came shortly after Trump said Tuesday he will release the \"unredacted transcript\" of his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- a call which has been scrutinized in the wake of the whistleblower complaint and Trump\\'s admission that he pushed Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden\\'s son Hunter during the conversation.\\n\\nThere is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.\\n\\nThe lawyers for the intel community whistleblower confirmed later on Tuesday in a statement that they wrote to the acting DNI asking for guidance on \"the appropriate security practices to permit a meeting, if needed\" with members of the intelligence committee.\\n\\n\"Today, we wrote to the Acting Director of National Intelligence to request specific guidance as to the appropriate security practices to permit a meeting, if needed, with the Members of the Intelligence Oversight Committees. We await a timely response from the Acting Director providing such guidance,\" wrote Andrew Bakaj, the lead attorney for the whistleblower.\\n\\nIn a letter to Bakaj, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence\\'s General Counsel commended the whistleblower for acting in \"good faith\" and in full compliance with the law, in a letter to the whistleblower\\'s attorneys.\\n\\n\"I also want to take this opportunity to state that we have every reason to believe that your client - our IC colleague - has acted in good faith and fully complied with the law,\" wrote Jason Klitenic.\\n\\nKlitenic also wrote that the whistleblower\\'s disclosure does \"not fall within the statutory definition of an \\'urgent concern.\\'\" But he added that because the complaint involves potentially privileged communications, they are consulting with other \"Executive Branch stakeholders\" before responding with the requested guidance about meeting with lawmakers.\\n\\n\"I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine,\" Trump tweeted while attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York.\\n\\nTrump also admitted that he delayed aid to Ukraine ahead of the call to Zelensky, when he pushed the leader to look into potential rival Joe Biden and his son\\'s work in Ukraine, giving the excuse that he was waiting for European nations to contribute their fair share of aid and claiming there was \"never any quid pro quo.\"\\n\\nBut on Monday, The Washington Post first reported that the President had directed his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million of US military and security aid to Ukraine in the days before he spoke with Zelensky.\\n\\nDemocrats ramping up pressure\\n\\nWhile Trump remains defiant, asserting he did nothing wrong, Democrats have continued to ramp up calls for action.\\n\\nBut Schiff vowed last week to mount an extensive investigation into the whistleblower controversy dominating Washington and said Congress will get to the bottom of why those details are being withheld from lawmakers come \"hell or high water,\" asserting that the case involves something \"more sinister\" than a policy difference.\\n\\nHe and other congressional Democrats have been growing more and more agitated with the White House and Maguire, who have blocked their access to the complaint. Democratic lawmakers contend that Maguire is violating the law in refusing to turn over the complaint, something his office disputes.\\n\\nSchiff has maintained that he has yet to see the complaint itself and does not know the identity of the whistleblower.\\n\\nCNN reported last week that the White House has been advising the nation\\'s top intelligence agency that the complaint is outside intelligence activities covered by laws governing intelligence whistleblowers, according to three sources familiar with the matter.\\n\\nDuring a closed-door briefing with Schiff\\'s committee last Thursday, Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community\\'s inspector general, would only discuss the process for his handling of the whistleblower\\'s concerns, the chairman said. Though lawmakers pressed him for details on the complaint, their efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.\\n\\nThe inspector general does not have the authority to discuss the details of the complaint with Congress because the DNI has not shared the actual report with the committee and had apparently not otherwise authorized Atkinson to share those details.\\n\\nThe intelligence whistleblower act does not allow for details to be provided until the actual complaint has been given to Congress, CNN legal contributor Steve Vladeck explained at the time.\\n\\nAlthough the official details of the complaint have not been provided to members of Congress, Atkinson told the panel during the briefing that it raised concerns about multiple actions but would not say if those instances involved Trump, according to sources familiar with the briefing.\\n\\nDNI scheduled to appear before Congress on Thursday\\n\\nThree House committees launched subsequent investigations into the issue. Maguire is scheduled to appear before the House Intelligence Committee in an open hearing Thursday. He and Atkinson will also brief Senate Intelligence Committee members behind closed doors that same day, a source familiar with the planning told CNN.\\n\\nCNN had earlier reported, citing a source familiar with the case, that the complaint was prompted by concerns over communications between the President and a foreign leader.\\n\\nThe alleged whistleblower didn\\'t have direct knowledge of the communications that partly prompted the complaint to the inspector general, an official briefed on the matter told CNN on Thursday.\\n\\nInstead, the whistleblower\\'s concerns came in part from learning information that was not obtained during the course of their work, and those details have played a role in the administration\\'s determination that the complaint didn\\'t fit the reporting requirements under the intelligence whistleblower law, the official said.',\n",

       "  'authors': [],\n",
       "  'text': '(CNN) More than half the US House of Representatives have now said they support an impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump.\\n\\nThere are at leastHouse Democrats -- according to a CNN count -- who publicly stated support for impeachment proceedings. Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, a former Republican who has since become an independent , has also called for an impeachment investigation, bringing the total number of representatives to, or more than half of the 435-member chamber.\\n\\nReaching the halfway mark on this issue is a significant development as a majority of the House would be needed to vote to impeach the President in order to send the process to the Senate. However, CNN\\'s count includes many Democrats who say they support an impeachment investigation but are still waiting for the results of the probe before deciding whether to finally vote to impeach Trump.\\n\\nEven if the House could pass the vote, it likely would go nowhere in the Republican-controlled Senate, one of many reasons the issue has been politically divisive among Democrats and a large part of why House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had for months avoided calling Democratic investigations an impeachment inquiry.\\n\\nStill there has been a surge in support -- more than 75 House members in about three days -- of launching such an inquiry amid a growing controversy over Trump\\'s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky where he discussed former Vice President Joe Biden.\\n\\nCNN previously reported that Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden\\'s son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation, and that call was part of the whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN. Trump has admitted he delayed aid to Ukraine ahead of the call, but has denied doing anything improper.\\n\\nThere has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.\\n\\nOn September 24, Pelosi announced that the House would formally conduct an impeachment investigation. Here\\'s which members of her party support that move in their own words:\\n\\nHouse Democrats who have publicly stated they at least support starting an impeachment inquiry:\\n\\n1. Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island\\n\\nIn advance of former White House counsel Don McGahn declining to show up for the House Judiciary Committee in May, Cicilline said the \"time has come\" for an impeachment inquiry.\\n\\n\"The White House and the President have attempted to impede our ability to get to the truth ... we have a responsibility at some point to open up an inquiry if this kind of obstruction, interference and stonewalling continues,\" Cicilline told reporters.\\n\\n2. Rep. Ted Lieu of California\\n\\nLieu spoke on CNN in May and said that while he didn\\'t support full impeachment, he was among those Democrats supporting starting an impeachment inquiry.\\n\\n\"Let me just be very clear,\" Lieu told CNN\\'s Wolf Blitzer. \"Democrats are not saying impeachment. What I\\'m saying and what some others are saying is an impeachment inquiry, which is, we have to start these investigations to see if we should do impeachment.\"\\n\\nWhen Blitzer followed to clarify if Lieu supported \"beginning impeachment procedures\" but not full impeachment, Lieu responded \"That is correct. Because we need to build a record in these committees.\"\\n\\n3. Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington\\n\\nJayapal spoke on CNN in May and tweeted , \"I joined @wolfblitzer to discuss how @HouseJudiciary will hold this President and his administration accountable. Judge Mehta\\'s decision was important - but we still have to do our jobs and uphold the Constitution. For me, that means pursuing an impeachment inquiry.\"\\n\\n4. Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas\\n\\nEscobar was among lawmakers who pushed in May for Pelosi and Nadler to take a more aggressive stance than they\\'re currently taking and start an impeachment inquiry.\\n\\nShe also tweeted , \"I believe we need to begin an impeachment inquiry.\"\\n\\n5. Rep. Val Demings of Florida\\n\\nDemings told CNN in May that the evidence contained in the Mueller report was sufficient for Democrats to take the next, fateful step.\\n\\n\"I believe it\\'s pretty clear that the President made numerous attempts to obstruct justice or obstructed justice,\" Demings, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, told CNN\\'s Jake Tapper on \"The Lead.\"\\n\\n\"And so I believe, based on that information, as I did a month ago, that we have enough to begin those proceedings.\"\\n\\n6. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas\\n\\nJackson Lee, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, told reporters in May that she planned to introduce \"a resolution of investigation\" that will call on the House Judiciary Committee to investigate whether there is \"sufficient grounds\" to move forward with impeachment.\\n\\n7. Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky\\n\\nYarmuth, who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, told reporters in May, \"I think it\\'s time\" to begin the proceedings. On CNN, he said he\\'s not alone.\\n\\n\"I think what we have, John, is we have a situation in which I think a growing majority of our caucus believes that impeachment is going to be inevitable,\" Yarmuth told CNN\\'s John Berman on \"New Day .\" \"But they also believe that we need to pursue the investigations that are going on to make sure that certain conduct of the administration and the President that they need to be held accountable for is discovered.\"\\n\\n8. Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee\\n\\nCohen, who is a member of the House Judiciary Committee, has long been a proponent of impeachment and introduced articles of impeachment against Trump in November 2017.\\n\\n\"The time has come to make clear to the American people and to this President that his train of injuries to our Constitution must be brought to an end through impeachment,\" Cohen said in a statement at the time . \"I believe there is evidence that he attempted to obstruct an investigation into Russia\\'s interference with the U.S. presidential election and links between between Russia and the Trump campaign, most notably the firing of FBI Director James Comey.\"\\n\\n9. Rep. Al Green of Texas\\n\\nGreen was the first House Democrat to formally seek Trump\\'s impeachment from the House floor in comments he made in May 2017.\\n\\n\"This is about my position. This is about what I believe. And this is where I stand. I will not be moved. The President must be impeached,\" Green said at the time . \"For those who do not know, impeachment does not mean that the President would be found guilty. It simply means that the House of Representatives will bring charges against the President. It\\'s similar to an indictment but not quite the same thing.\"\\n\\n10. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York\\n\\nIn a series of tweets, Ocasio-Cortez said that she will be signing on to an impeachment resolution led by fellow freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, following the release of the special counsel Robert Mueller\\'s report in April.\\n\\n\"Mueller\\'s report is clear in pointing to Congress\\' responsibility in investigating obstruction of justice by the President. It is our job as outlined in Article 1, Sec 2, Clause 5 of the US Constitution. As such, I\\'ll be signing onto @RashidaTlaib\\'s impeachment resolution,\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on April 18.\\n\\n11. Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas\\n\\nCastro, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN in May that it\\'s time to begin an impeachment inquiry immediately given the White House stonewalling of Congress\\' oversight.\\n\\n12. Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia\\n\\nBeyer announced in May his support for starting an impeachment inquiry in a statement.\\n\\n\"The time has come for the House of Representatives to open an impeachment inquiry into the conduct of President Trump,\" Beyer said. \"Endorsing such a course is not easy, and I do not do so lightly, but I believe that the President has left Congress no other option but to pursue it.\\n\\n13. Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado\\n\\nNeguse tweeted last month \"The findings detailed in the Special Counsel\\'s report, and the Administration\\'s pattern of wholesale obstruction of Congress since the report\\'s release, make clear that it is time to open an impeachment inquiry.\"\\n\\n14. Rep. Jackie Speier of California\\n\\nSpeier told CNN\\'s \"New Day\" in May that she supported starting the impeachment inquiry process.\\n\\n\"I believe that an inquiry into impeachment is required at this time,\" Speier said.\\n\\n15. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland\\n\\nRaskin, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, was among the Democrats who asked Pelosi at a meeting in May about pursuing an impeachment inquiry.\\n\\nRaskin told CNN the following day, \"I would totally support opening an impeachment inquiry at this point.\"\\n\\n16. Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania\\n\\nScanlon, a member of the Judiciary Committee, tweeted in May that she supported an impeachment inquiry after a text message conversation with her son.\\n\\n17. Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado\\n\\n\"The Mueller report details many instances in which President Trump actively attempted to interfere with the investigation into his campaign\\'s potentially treasonous ties with Russia,\" she stated. \"The President\\'s actions are clearly beneath the high personal, ethical and legal standards our founders envisioned in the executive branch, and, as such, constitute a prima facie case to trigger an impeachment investigation.\"\\n\\n18. Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin\\n\\nPocan released a statement supporting starting an impeachment inquiry in May.\\n\\n\"Stonewalling Congress on witnesses and the unredacted Mueller report only enhances the President\\'s appearance of guilt, and as a result, he has pushed Congress to a point where we must start an impeachment inquiry,\" Pocan said.\\n\\n19. Rep. Earl Blumenauer of Oregon\\n\\nBlumenauer released a statement in early May backing the start of an impeachment inquiry.\\n\\n\"The Mueller investigation was limited in its capacity to take action and draw conclusions due to Justice Department guidelines,\" he wrote. \"Yet, it was a treasure trove of information that deserves further investigation, which should be done in the House—the only chamber willing to hold this president accountable. For that reason, I am joining Congresswoman Tlaib in calling for the Judiciary Committee to carry out a formal investigation regarding potential impeachable offenses by Donald Trump.\"\\n\\n20. Rep. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania\\n\\nDean, a member of the Judiciary Committee, told CNN in an interview in May that she supported starting an impeachment inquiry.\\n\\n\"We can\\'t just constantly put out lawful subpoena, try to do our constitutional oversight, be stonewalled by an administration that\\'s just simply trying to cover up bad behaviors, and not change course,\" Dean said. \"And so what we\\'ve been trying to do is investigative oversight. I believe at the point you have Barr fail to come forward and produce documents, you have McGahn fail to produce documents and come forward, enough\\'s enough. It\\'s time to begin an investigation, an inquiry, as to impeachment.\"\\n\\n21. Rep. Dwight Evans of Pennsylvania\\n\\nEvans has openly supported steps toward impeachment since Trump\\'s first year in office. In December 2017, he released a statement explaining his vote not to table a House resolution calling for impeachment\\n\\n\"After being in Congress for over a year and observing President Trump\\'s questionable actions I strongly believe there should at least be a discussion about whether or not President Trump\\'s actions met the bar of impeachment,\" Evans stated.\\n\\nIn February 2018, Evans was co-host of an event on the \"Party to Impeach\" tour with billionaire Tom Steyer, who has long publicly advocated impeaching Trump.\\n\\n\"The President is not above the Constitution,\" Evans told Philly Magazine at the time . \"He needs to be held accountable. My constituents have raised serious concerns about the President\\'s actions.\"\\n\\n22. Rep. Jared Huffman of California\\n\\nHuffman signed on to efforts to start impeachment proceedings in December 2017.\\n\\n\"Impeachment is an extraordinary measure, but it should be clear to anyone who examines the facts that President Trump\\'s actions justify his impeachment, including his efforts to obstruct justice, his self-enrichment and serial violations of the Emoluments Clause, and his involvement in a cover-up stemming from his campaign\\'s very likely collusion with Russian interests to undermine the 2016 presidential election,\" Huffman said in a statement at the time.\\n\\n23. Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts\\n\\nMoulton, who is running for the Democratic nomination for president, said earlier this year that he supported moving forward with impeachment proceedings.\\n\\n\"I voted on this a over a year ago, and I said that proceedings should move forward,\" he told reporters at a campaign stop on April 23 in Manchester, New Hampshire.\\n\\nMoulton was careful to note \"it\\'s not the right time to vote on impeachment, because we don\\'t have all the facts in, we don\\'t even have the full version of the Mueller report, but we absolutely should move forward on the proceedings, so we can have this debate in Congress, and frankly I think it\\'s long overdue.\"\\n\\n24. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota\\n\\nOmar has called for some form of impeachment proceedings against Trump since before she was sworn in to Congress in January.\\n\\n\"We know that this President, this administration every day has gone a little bit closer to being impeached. ... We won\\'t be having these conversations on whether to do it, but it\\'s going to be when and how,\" Omar told CNN in December.\\n\\nMore recently she\\'s signed petitions to start impeachment proceedings, as well as signing on to Tlaib\\'s impeachment resolution in April.\\n\\n25. Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts\\n\\nPressley was among those lawmakers who signed on to Tlaib\\'s impeachment resolution following the release of the redacted Mueller report.\\n\\n\"That resolution will come before a vote before the Congress and it asks that, dependent on that vote, that we follow up procedurally in committee,\" Pressley told Boston Public Radio on April 19 . \"I mean here\\'s the thing — I have felt for a long time that this administration has lost all moral authority and there are many impeachable offenses.\"\\n\\n26. Rep. Kathleen Rice of New York\\n\\nRice tweeted in April that Congress should start impeachment proceedings.\\n\\n\"For over two years the President has systematically dismantled our democracy and defied the rule of law. This cannot stand,\" she tweeted . \"Congress has a moral obligation to put our politics aside and take action. We need to start impeachment proceedings.\"\\n\\n27. Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan\\n\\nOn the night of her swearing in in Congress, Tlaib made headlines when she told a crowd: \"We\\'re going to impeach the motherf****r.\" She\\'s since authored her own resolution to start impeachment proceedings.\\n\\n28. Rep. Filemon Vela of Texas\\n\\nVela tweeted in August 2018 that \"we must impeach crooked Donnie,\" following news of a guilty verdict for Trump\\'s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\\n\\nVela also signed on to Tlaib\\'s impeachment resolution on April 30.\\n\\n29. Rep. Maxine Waters of California\\n\\nWaters, the chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, has long called for starting the process of impeachment for the President.\\n\\n\"When are the people of this country going to wake up to the fact that this president is a disgusting liar, documented to have lied over 8,000 times in 2 yrs? Add to that his recent, blatant lies on our nation\\'s intel chiefs\\' testimony in the US Senate. Past time for impeachment!\" she tweeted in January.\\n\\n30. Rep. Brad Sherman of California\\n\\nSherman was among the earliest advocates for impeachment, signing on to a resolution with Green in July 2017.\\n\\n\"Recent disclosures by Donald Trump Jr. indicate that Trump\\'s campaign was eager to receive assistance from Russia,\" Sherman said in a statement at the time. \"It now seems likely that the President had something to hide when he tried to curtail the investigation of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and the wider Russian probe. I believe his conversations with, and subsequent firing of, FBI Director James Comey constitute Obstruction of Justice.\"\\n\\n31. Rep. Suzanne Bonamici of Oregon\\n\\nBonamici released a statement in May supporting the start of an impeachment inquiry.\\n\\n\"I am gravely concerned about the actions of President Trump and the growing evidence of possible impeachable offenses, including obstruction of justice, committing human rights violations by separating children from their families, and profiting from the presidency,\" Bonamici said in the statement. \"I\\'ve said before that impeachment should be an option, but we must approach it deliberately.

       "  'text': '(CNN) Calls to impeach President Donald Trump began among some Democrats almost the day he was inaugurated. They ballooned after former special counsel Robert Mueller\\'s report to Congress about interactions between the Trump campaign and Russia and, separately, Trump\\'s efforts to squash the investigation, potentially obstructing justice.\\n\\nBut now that Trump has admitted to trying to influence Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden at the same time he had frozen US military aid to Ukraine , the calls among Democrats have reached a tipping point and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the House will officially initiate impeachment proceedings against Trump.\\n\\nHere\\'s what needs to happen for Democrats in the House to impeach Trump , which seems increasingly likely, and for the Senate to remove him from office, which still seems very unlikely. Much of the information here is taken from a report by the Congressional Research Service and other sources.\\n\\nInitiating impeachment proceedings\\n\\nThe two most recent presidential impeachments began with a vote in the full House. Pelosi has broken with this format and has chosen to instruct the six House committees already investigating Trump to proceed \"under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry.\"\\n\\nRep. Jerry Nadler, the current chair of the House Judiciary Committee, has argued that his current oversight of the Trump administration equaled the beginnings of an impeachment inquiry.\\n\\nFormalizing it could help the committee in its effort to get Trump administration officials to cooperate. Instead, they have at times stonewalled, claimed executive privilege, and ignored subpoenas.\\n\\nInvestigating impeachable offenses\\n\\nImpeachable offenses, according to the Constitution, include \"Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" What exactly constitutes those crimes, particularly High Crimes and Misdemeanors, has been the subject of vigorous debate throughout US history.\\n\\nDuring previous impeachment inquiries, a House committee, usually the Judiciary Committee or its subcommittee, conducts an investigation to see if a federal official\\'s conduct warrants impeachment.\\n\\nThis will be a contentious process.\\n\\nClinton sent lawyers and legal experts to argue his case and defend him before the House Judiciary Committee\\n\\nBut in Pelosi\\'s version, each of the six committees -- Judiciary, Intelligence, Ways and Means, Financial Services, Oversight and Foreign Affairs -- will continue with their investigations, looking at different elements of Trump\\'s presidency, his past and his businesses. These committees months ago already sorted out the different areas they are investigating, and many of the investigations are still charging ahead or their fights are tied up in court.\\n\\nHouse votes\\n\\nAfter these inquiries, in another break from recent precedent, each of the committees will provide input to include in articles of impeachment that would be written up under the House Judiciary Committee, which would vote on whether to refer them to the full House of Representatives. After that committee vote, the articles, if approved, are given special status on the House floor and it requires a simple majority of voting lawmakers to approve them.\\n\\nHere are the articles of impeachment offered against President Bill Clinton\\n\\nHere are the articles of impeachment prepared for Richard Nixon\\n\\nCurrently, Democrats hold a 235 to 198 majority over Republicans. Michigan Rep. Justin Amash , who left the Republican Party in July after announcing his support for impeachment proceedings, is the chamber\\'s one independent and there is one vacancy. Assuming Amash votes with Democrats, they could afford to lose 18 Democrats and still achieve a majority.\\n\\nAt this point, Trump would face a choice shared by only three other presidents: be impeached and fight for your office in the Senate or resign. Both Clinton in 1999 and President Andrew Johnson in 1868 fought in the House and ultimately survived a Senate trial. Nixon, after learning that Republicans would not support him during impeachment, resigned before the House could vote to impeach him.\\n\\nThere were four articles of impeachment against Clinton, but only two were approved, on mostly party-line votes with a few defections.\\n\\nA Senate trial\\n\\nAfter the House votes to impeach a President, the Constitution calls for a trial in the US Senate. There is some question as to whether Republicans in the Senate would even bother since they likely have the votes to easily dismiss the charges.\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell simply decided not hold a vote on Merrick Garland\\'s nomination by President Barack Obama to sit on the Supreme Court. There\\'s been plenty of speculation about whether McConnell would simply decide not to hold an impeachment trial.\\n\\nIf there were a trial, senators become jurors and the chief justice of the US Supreme Court presides -- that\\'s John Roberts . The House votes on managers who bring the trial in the Senate. Although they might be helped by outside counsel, the House managers actually bring the trial and present evidence. The impeached official can offer a defense or have counsel do it.\\n\\nWhile Democrats hold a majority in the House, Republicans control the Senate with a 53-45 majority. Two independents usually side with Democrats. But it takes a supermajority to remove a President from office. That means 67 senators would have to agree that Trump should be removed from office.\\n\\nWith the current party split, 20 Republicans would have to turn on him. At the moment, exactly zero Republicans senators have said anything close to supporting the idea of impeachment.\\n\\nHow long does this take?\\n\\nPelosi has not given a timeframe for this process but she told her colleagues it would be done \"expeditiously,\" and Nadler has hoped to conclude it by the end of the year.\\n\\nThis process can take months. For Johnson, the entire process lasted 94 days, from first congressional action to Senate acquittal, lasted from February 22, 1868 to May 26, 1868.\\n\\nFor Richard Nixon, it lasted 184 days. The House approved the impeachment inquiry on February 6, 1974 and Nixon resigned.\\n\\nFor Clinton, it lasted 127 days. The House approved the impeachment inquiry on October 8, 1998, and the Senate acquitted him on February 12, 1999.',\n",

       "  'text': 'House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced the formalization of an impeachment inquiry into President Trump Tuesday evening, saying \"the president must be held accountable\" for his \"betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections.\"\\n\\nThe speaker effectively endorsed the process, which to some degree has already been underway, after facing fresh pressure from inside the caucus to act. The move could help Democrats\\' disputed arguments in court that impeachment proceedings were in fact in progress, which could entitle Congress to obtain additional documents.\\n\\nPelosi specifically charged that the administration had violated the law by not turning over a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump\\'s July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence was blocking the release of that complaint, she said: \"This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal.\"\\n\\nTrump allegedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had separately been accused of corruption.\\n\\nBut there were several indicators throughout the day that Pelosi\\'s gambit could backfire, as Republicans predicted over the weekend.\\n\\n\"It is a colossal error.\" — Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn\\n\\nTrump vowed earlier Tuesday to release a \"complete\" transcript of his call with Zelensky by Wednesday.\\n\\nAdditionally, a senior administration official told Fox News late Tuesday that the White House is working as quickly as it can to release to Congress a whistleblower complaint, as long as it\\'s legally possible. The official told Fox News that the White House had nothing to hide, that there has been no wrongdoing,\\n\\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that the complaint must be declassified first, but will likely be in Congress\\' hands by the end of the week.\\n\\nAnd The New York Times reported that the White House had dropped its objection to the whistleblower speaking to Congress. That came after the GOP-controlled Senate passed a unanimous resolution seeking access to the whistleblower\\'s complaint.\\n\\nWATCH BIDEN RECOUNT HOW HE PUSHED FOR SHOKIN\\'S FIRING\\n\\nStill, Pelosi appeared undeterred -- and she and other Democrats suggested to reporters that impeachment could be appropriate even for matters unrelated to the Ukraine probe.\\n\\n\"This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,\" Pelosi said. \"Therefore, today, I\\'m announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I\\'m directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella.\\n\\n\"The president must be held accountable,\" she continued. \"No one is above the law.\"\\n\\nInvoking the \"darkest days of the American Revolution,\" Pelosi called on lawmakers to honor their constitutional oath to protect the country \"from all enemies, foreign and domestic.\"\\n\\nThe Democratic-led committees then would gather evidence and present it to Pelosi and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who would make the ultimate determination on whether to hold an impeachment vote.\\n\\nA Democratic source told Fox News that the House Intelligence Committee, led by California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, would take the lead in the investigation -- and that Nadler might not be pleased with the arrangement.\\n\\n“I don’t think he’s happy that he has less influence here, but everybody is on the same page and has the same role,” the source said of Nadler.\\n\\nSchiff “will have a heavy role here because the foundation of the Ukraine allegations is thorough his committee,\" the source said.\\n\\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., responded to Pelosi\\'s statement by noting that Democrats have been pushing to impeach Trump for years, for a variety of reasons.\\n\\n\"Nancy Pelosi may be Speaker of the House,\" McCarthy said, \"but she does not speak for America. ... What she said today made no difference in what\\'s been going on. This election is over. It\\'s time to put the public before politics.\"\\n\\nTrump, for his part, ripped into Democrats in a series of tweets immediately after Pelosi\\'s comments, writing that \"PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT\" was in progress again.\\n\\n\"Such an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage,\" Trump wrote. \"So bad for our Country!\"\\n\\nHe added: \"They never even saw the transcript of the call. A total Witch Hunt!\"\\n\\nTrump is set to meet with Zelensky in New York on Wednesday. The visit was previously scheduled, unrelated to the whistleblower allegation, although the two leaders are expected to face questions about the matter from reporters.\\n\\nHouse Oversight Committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, called Democrats\\' efforts predictable and destructive in his own fiery statement.\\n\\n\"Democrats have been trying to impeach the President since the beginning of this Congress,\" Jordan said. \"Michael Cohen\\'s testimony was a bust. John Dean\\'s testimony was a waste of time. The Mueller report did not live up to the hype.\\n\\n\"Speaker Pelosi\\'s decision to pursue impeachment now - on the basis of unsubstantiated, indirect, and anonymous allegations - only shows that the Speaker has finally succumbed to unrelenting pressure from the socialist wing of the Democrat Party,\" Jordan added. \"This was never about Russian collusion or Ukrainian prosecutions. It is all about undoing the 2016 election and the will of the American people.\"\\n\\nPelosi had met Tuesday afternoon with her caucus of House Democrats prior to giving the planned statement.\\n\\nWary of compromising the electability of vulnerable Democrats in the caucus, Pelosi had long resisted taking the dramatic step publicly -- even though other top Democrats have insisted, in legal filings and the media, that an impeachment inquiry already has been in progress for months.\\n\\nSwing district Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., acknowledged to Fox News that supporting the impeachment inquiry \"could\" affect her electorally, but she maintained that Trump voters in her district \"understand,\" and that Trump crossed a red line.\\n\\nRepublicans said the move would prove to be a major political mistake.\\n\\nTRUMP VOWS TO RELEASE TRANSCRIPT OF CALL WITH UKRAINE\\'S PRESIDENT\\n\\n\"It is a colossal error,\" Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn told Fox News just prior to Pelosi\\'s comments. \"And, I’m kind of surprised that Speaker Pelosi, as shrewd as she is, would let it get to this point.\"\\n\\nPelosi\\'s impeachment imprimatur came after a flurry of those swing-district Democrats late Monday wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post backing an impeachment inquiry, or a fact-finding look at whether an impeachment vote by the full House is warranted. And on Saturday night, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said Democrats\\' failure to act on impeachment had been a \"national scandal.\"\\n\\nPelosi\\'s decision Tuesday heartened Democrats who have long called for impeaching the president, only to be stalled after Special Counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence of Russian collusion by the Trump campaign.\\n\\nBut, new momentum built quickly for the move after news of the whistleblower complaint surfaced.\\n\\nIn remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the aid money to Ukraine\\'s investigative actions. “No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said. But, he also repeatedly called the Bidens\\' actions in Ukraine a \"disgrace,\" acknowledged that Biden had come up during the call and added: \"It\\'s very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?\"\\n\\nBIDEN CAMPAIGN LIKELY TO END, AS UKRAINE ISSUE WILL \\'BACKFIRE,\\' NUNES SAYS\\n\\nTrump tweeted Tuesday that he would make a \"complete\" transcript of his phone call public on Wednesday.\\n\\n\"I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine,\" Trump wrote. \"You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!\"\\n\\nJustice Department lawyers, as well as lawyers at the White House, have been advising White House officials to release the transcript since last week, a source familiar with the conversations told Fox News.\\n\\nAt an event Tuesday, Pelosi intimated that impeachment would remain on the table, regardless of what the transcript showed. Many conservatives charged that she was moving the goalposts and lowering expectations.\\n\\n\"We have many other, shall we say, candidates for impeachable offenses in terms of the Constitution, but this one is the most understandable by the public,\" Pelosi said, referring to the Ukraine phone call allegation. \"It\\'s really important to know this: There is no requirement that there be a quid-pro-quo in the conversation.\"\\n\\nOther prominent Democrats also seemingly said Trump should be impeached no matter what.\\n\\n\"The president has committed several impeachable offenses,\" Ocasio-Cortez told reporters after Pelosi\\'s remarks on impeachment. In another indication that Democrats were apparently hedging their bets on the Ukraine matter, Ocasio-Cortez said alleged Emoluments Clause violations by the president could be included in prospective articles of impeachment.\\n\\nFLASHBACK: IN APRIL, TRUMP SAYS HILLARY-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS \\'BIG,\\' WILL BE INVESTIGATED\\n\\nDemocrats continued to push for the whistleblower to testify and to see the full whistleblower complaint throughout the day. Schiff, D-Calif., said Tuesday afternoon that testimony from the whistleblower might be imminent.\\n\\n\"We have been informed by the whistleblower’s counsel that their client would like to speak to our committee and has requested guidance from the Acting DNI [Director of National Intelligence] as to how to do so,\" Schiff said in a tweet. \"We‘re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower’s testimony as soon as this week.\"\\n\\nIt was unclear if Acting DNI Joseph Maguire would provide that guidance. Maguire is expected to testify himself before the House Intelligence Committee at an open hearing on Thursday -- but Maguire has refused to share some information, including the complaint.\\n\\nA source familiar with the matter told Fox News this week that the whistleblower had no firsthand knowledge of Trump\\'s call with Zelensky.\\n\\nLate Monday, attorneys for the whistleblower released a statement confirming Schiff\\'s statement, and noting that they \"await a timely response from the Acting Director providing such guidance.\"\\n\\n\"We support the bi-partisan, unanimous resolution passed by the Senate regarding our client’s lawful whistleblower complaint and call upon the Acting Director of National Intelligence to transmit the complete disclosure to the two Intelligence Oversight Committees,\" the lawyers noted.\\n\\nGIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN\\n\\nAs Pelosi met with her caucus, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, called for the Senate and House Intelligence Committees to immediately have access to the whistleblower complaint. The panels \"should be allowed to evaluate the complaint in a deliberate and bipartisan manner consistent with applicable statutes and processes in order to safeguard classified and sensitive information,\" Schumer asserted.\\n\\nPelosi and House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., also released a joint statement Tuesday announcing an imminent resolution condemning the White House\\'s failure to turn over all related documents to Congress.\\n\\n\"Allegations that the President of the United States sought to enlist a foreign government to interfere in our democratic process by investigating one of his political rivals – and may have used the withholding of Congressionally-appropriated foreign assistance days earlier as intimidation – are deeply alarming,\" Hoyer and Pelosi wrote.\\n\\nThey demanded the whistleblower\\'s protection, and for \"the Acting Director of National Intelligence [to] provide Congress the [whistleblower] complaint, as specified under the law, and all requests for documents and testimony relating to this allegation.\"\\n\\nPENCE RIPS BIDEN OVER UKRAINE HYPOCRISY IN \\'HANNITY\\' INTERVIEW\\n\\nPelosi and Hoyer continued: \"On Wednesday, the House will vote on a resolution making it clear Congress’s disapproval of the Administration’s effort to block the release of the complaint and the need to protect the whistleblower. This is not a partisan matter, it’s about the integrity.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, Yahoo News reported that the GOP-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee had written to the whistleblower\\'s attorney, requesting a closed-door interview.\\n\\nThe precise implications of Pelosi\\'s shift on impeachment were unclear, given Democrats\\' previous rhetoric on the topic. Earlier this month, Hoyer contradicted some of his colleagues by insisting that Congress is not engaged in any kind of \"impeachment inquiry\" -- before reversing course hours later in a \"clarifying\" press statement.\\n\\nOther top Democrats, including Nadler, have insisted repeatedly in court and in public that an impeachment inquiry has been in progress.\\n\\n“It has been an impeachment inquiry,” Nadler has said. “What we are doing is clear. It has been very clear. It continues to be very clear.\"\\n\\nBut, when asked if he thought it was an impeachment inquiry, Hoyer initially responded with an emphatic “No.”\\n\\nHoyer added: “I think the delineation ought to be whether or not they are considering a resolution of impeachment.”\\n\\nThe Justice Department, in court filings earlier this month, sought to block congressional Democrats\\' bid for secret grand jury material from the Mueller investigation by citing the confusion inside the caucus over whether or not they\\'re pursuing an \"impeachment investigation.\"\\n\\n\"The committee’s own description of its investigation makes clear that it is too far removed from any potential judicial proceeding to qualify,\" the DOJ said.\\n\\nA total of 172 House Democrats have now signaled strong support for an impeachment inquiry -- 235 Democrats and 198 Republicans are in the House, with one pro-impeachment independent. A majority would be required to successfully impeach the president. A highly unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would be needed to convict and remove the president.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nVice President Mike Pence would then take office in that scenario.\\n\\n\"The ironic thing is is that everything that our critics in the media are leveling at the president from this phone call, and leveling at our administration, everything that Democrats on Capitol Hill are running off and describing -- Vice President Joe Biden bragged about -- which was a quid-pro-quo -- withholding American aid in exchange for a specific action,\" Pence told Fox News\\' \"Hannity\" on Monday.\\n\\nFox News\\' Chad Pergram, Brooke Singman, Ronn Blitzer and Jake Gibson contributed to this report.',\n",

       " {'title': 'Trump slams open-border activists for ‘evil’ agenda, decries Iran ‘bloodlust’ in fiery UN speech',\n",
       "  'authors': ['Adam Shaw'],\n",
       "  'text': 'President Trump, in a fiery address Tuesday before the U.N. General Assembly, tore into open-border activists for pushing what he described as an \"evil\" agenda under the \"cloak\" of social justice, while warning Iran to abandon its confrontational course and delivering arguably his most robust defense yet of his nationalist philosophy.\\n\\n\"Today, I have a message for those open border activists who cloak themselves in the rhetoric of social justice: Your policies are not just, your policies are cruel and evil,\" he said, accusing them of promoting human smuggling and the \"erasure of national borders.\"\\n\\nAMERICA \\'ISOLATED\\' AT UN? GENERAL ASSEMBLY BREAKS WITH US ON MOST VOTES, REPORT FINDS\\n\\n“You are empowering criminal organizations that prey on innocent men, women and children. You put your own false sense of virtue before the lives and well-being of countless innocent people,” he said. \"When you undermine border security, you are undermining human rights and human dignity.\"\\n\\nHe delivered the broadside as part of a message promoting border security, in the U.S. and around the world. This dovetailed with a broader theme of railing against open borders and \"globalists,\" in the halls of the world body increasingly known for espousing that approach.\\n\\nThe president\\'s tone was steady and somber. But the message was that of a muscular nationalism that he has spent the better part of three years defining. As part of his speech, he later ripped into social media giants, media groups and academics -- whom he accused of being part of a \"permanent political class\" that sought to undermine the will of the people.\\n\\n\"Wise leaders always put the good of their own people and their country first. The future does not belong to globalists, the future belongs to patriots,\" he said earlier in the speech. \"The future belongs to sovereign and independent nations who protect their citizens, respect their neighbors and honor the differences that make each country special and unique.\"\\n\\nHe advised member states, \"If you want freedom, take pride in your country. If you want democracy, hold on to your sovereignty. If you want peace, love your nation.\"\\n\\nTrump, who has centered his presidency around an “America First” agenda, used his 2017 and 2018 addresses to defend and promote the importance of national sovereignty -- a message that clashes with the more globalist outlook of the world body. He said that he wants to avoid \"endless wars\" but also promised to defend America militarily, if needed.\\n\\nHe used that message to pivot to Iran, urging the Islamic regime to put its people first and to abandon its quest for nuclear weapons and support of terror in the region. He told delegates that the U.S. does not seek conflict with other nations but that “I will never fail to defend America’s interests.”\\n\\nNEW UN AMBASSADOR KELLY CRAFT VOWS \\'STRONG AMERICAN LEADERSHIP\\' AS SHE TAKES HER POST\\n\\nHe accused Iran\\'s leaders of \"fueling the tragic wars in both Syria and Yemen,\" and of \"squandering their nation\\'s wealth in a fanatical quest for nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them.\"\\n\\n\"We must never allow this to happen,\" he said.\\n\\nHe was given a boost on his hardline stance with Iran on Monday when Britain, France and Germany joined the U.S. in blaming Iran for attacks earlier this month on key oil facilities in Saudi Arabia. They said in a statement that “there is no other plausible explanation” than that “Iran bears responsibility for this attack.”\\n\\n\"All nations have a duty to act, no responsible government should subsidize Iran\\'s bloodlust,\" he said, promising to tighten sanctions if Iran continued its aggression.\\n\\nThe move marks a significant win for the U.S., which has been trying to rally European nations to its side in its “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran. Last year it pulled out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, despite criticism from allies that had signed onto the pact.\\n\\nThe U.S. has since imposed waves of sanctions, including on Iran’s central bank last week. Trump said last week in the Oval Office that Iran could stop the sanctions if it would stop supporting terrorism. He has also opened the door to meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, he also used the speech to address the ongoing trade war with China, saying that at the heart of his vision is “an ambitious campaign to reform international trade.\"\\n\\n“For decades, the international trading system has been easily exploited by nations acting in very bad faith,” he said. “As jobs were outsourced, a small handful grew wealthy at the expense of the middle class.”\\n\\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nIn his criticism of other leaders, he also appeared to take a swipe at former U.S. leaders who let China gain international dominance.\\n\\n\"Globalism exerted a religious pull over past leaders, causing them to ignore their own national interests, but as far as America is concerned, those days are over,\" he said.\\n\\nFox News\\' John Roberts and Frank Miles contributed to this report.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday unveiled a massive tax on the wealthiest Americans that aims to diminish income inequality -- a central theme of his campaign -- and at least begin to finance the steep price tags for the numerous government programs the Democratic presidential candidate is proposing.\\n\\nThe release of the independent senator from Vermont\\'s ‘Tax on Extreme Wealth’ follows a similar plan from one of his top rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination, fellow progressive and populist lawmaker Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.\\n\\n“There should be no billionaires. We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people,” Sanders said on Twitter as he urged supporters to read his new plan. His campaign also sent an email under the subject line: \"Billionaires should not exist.\"\\n\\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\\n\\nIn his decades in Congress and during both of his runs for the White House, Sanders has railed against an American economic system that he says favors corporations and the rich, at the expense of the working class.\\n\\nSanders\\' plan, if enacted into law, would place a 1 percent tax on net worth over $32 million, a 2 percent tax on net worth between $50 million and $250 million, and a 3 percent tax on net worth between $250 million and $500 million. The proposed Sanders tax would increase to 4 percent net worth from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent for net worth from $1 billion to $2.5 billion, and ultimately reach 8 percent for wealth over $10 billion.\\n\\nThe Sanders campaign says their plan would impact approximately 180,000 households nationwide, and would raise about $4.35 trillion in government revenue by the 2028 budget year.\\n\\n“Our tax on extreme wealth would only apply to the wealthiest households in America and would cut the wealth of billionaires in half over 15 years, which would substantially break up the concentration of wealth and power of this small, privileged class,” Sanders said in an email to supporters announcing his plan.\\n\\nAnd he said that he would “use the revenue to fund our affordable housing plan, universal childcare, and help fund our work to guarantee health care as a right for every man, woman, and child in this country.\"\\n\\nThe Republican National Committee criticized Sanders, with spokesman Michael Joyce arguing that “no matter how many new taxes Bernie proposes, it still won’t come even close to covering the costs of Bernie’s socialist pie-in-the-sky policy proposals.”\\n\\nWarren’s plan – which she unveiled at the beginning of the year-- by comparison would place a 2 percent annual tax on net worth above $50 million and would slap a 3 percent tax on net worth above $1 billion.\\n\\nHer campaign says it would affect the top 70,000 households in the county and would bring in an estimated $2.6 trillion over 10 years.\\n\\nThe Sanders plan Affects about 180,000 households\\n\\n\\n\\nWould raise about $4.35 trillion in government revenue by the 2028 budget year\\n\\nThe Warren plan Affects the top 70,000 households\\n\\n\\n\\nWould bring in about $2.6 trillion over 10 years\\n\\nSanders, in order “ensure that the wealthy are not able to evade the tax,” is calling for creating a national registry and beefing up third-party reporting requirements, increasing funding for the Internal Revenue Service and requiring the IRS to perform audits of 30 percent of those in the 1 percent bracket and audits of all billionaires.\\n\\nHe’s also calling for a 40 percent exit tax on the net value of all assets under $1 billion and a steeper 60 percent on assets over $1 billion “for all wealthy individuals seeking to expatriate to avoid the tax.”\\n\\nPresident Trump’s re-election campaign took aim at Sanders, not specifically over his new plan but for vows by the senator and the rest of the Democratic field to repeal the tax cuts passed in 2017 by the then-GOP controlled Congress and signed into law by the president.\\n\\n“By repealing President Trump’s tax cuts, Sanders and the rest of the Democrats would raise taxes on almost all Americans, not just the very rich,” campaign spokesperson Erin Perrine said.',\n",

About $19 million of the aid will be used to train Guaidó’s team to govern if they are successful in ousting Maduro.

       "  'text': 'Former Vice President Joe Biden called Tuesday for impeachment proceedings against President Trump if his administration continues \"stonewalling\" Congress, blasting the president anew over his alleged attempt to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Biden family.\\n\\nThe Democratic presidential candidate, speaking in Delaware, stopped short of endorsing outright impeachment, but the statement signaled he is opening the door to those proceedings -- which many of his primary rivals have already demanded.\\n\\nPELOSI TO ADDRESS GROUNDSWELL OF TRUMP IMPEACHMENT CALLS INSIDE CAUCUS, AMID UKRAINE FUROR\\n\\n“It is time for the Congress to formally investigate the conduct of this president,” Biden said Tuesday, saying that Trump “should stop stonewalling” House committee investigations into his alleged misconduct.\\n\\n“If the president does not comply with requests from Congress … Donald Trump will leave Congress no choice, in my view, but to initiate impeachment,” Biden said.\\n\\n“That would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making.”\\n\\nBiden’s comments come after Trump vowed to release the transcript of a now-controversial phone call over the summer with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The move came after it was confirmed that the White House froze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine shortly before Trump allegedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter.\\n\\nThe White House contended that the reason for the freeze was tied to concerns about corruption. Multiple administration sources told Fox News on Tuesday that Trump wanted to be confident that the incoming Zelensky administration was going to take steps to end corruption before releasing the money.\\n\\nThe aid to Ukraine also came up in the context of other countries and questions about whether they were paying their share, sources said.\\n\\nTrump, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, insisted he only sought to hold up the Ukraine aid because he “wanted other countries to pay.”\\n\\n“There was no quid pro quo,” Trump said. “There was no pressure applied, nothing.”\\n\\nA day earlier, Trump denied linking the aid money to Ukraine’s investigative actions.\\n\\n“No I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said, also calling the Biden’s actions in Ukraine a “disgrace,” and adding: “It’s very important to talk about corruption. … Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?”\\n\\nThe furor began after a whistleblower complaint was reported last week, involving claims that Trump made an unspecified “promise” to Zelensky. A person familiar with the situation told Fox News that the whistleblower in question did not have “firsthand knowledge” of Trump’s conversation with Zelensky, but Democrats nonetheless want to see the complaint.\\n\\nBiden demanded that the administration make the complaint available to Congress, along with other documents and information that\\'s been requested.\\n\\nBiden has acknowledged that during the Obama administration, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden was on the board. Trump and his allies have openly voiced concerns about the now-Democratic presidential candidate\\'s role, including that he apparently threatened to withhold loan guarantees from Ukraine.\\n\\nAs it happens, Shokin was accused by many in Ukraine and in the West of being overly soft on corruption. But Trump has claimed Shokin “was after” Hunter Biden, suggesting that Joe Biden was out to protect his son.\\n\\nFLASHBACK: TRUMP SAYS CLINTON-UKRAINE ALLEGATIONS WILL BE INVESTIGATED\\n\\n“The very thing they’re accusing President Trump of doing, Biden did,” Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told “Fox & Friends” on Monday.\\n\\n“I can take the political attacks,” Biden countered Tuesday. “They’ll come and they’ll go, and in time they’ll soon be forgotten.”\\n\\n“But,\" he added, \"if we allow a president to get away with shredding the U.S. Constitution, that will last forever. This is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. This is a national issue and a security issue.”\\n\\nOn Capitol Hill, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was expected to announce a formal impeachment inquiry against the president.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nThere are now 164 House Democrats who have signaled strong support for possible impeachment proceedings. (235 Democrats and 198 Republicans are in the House, with one independent -- and a majority would be required to successfully impeach Trump. An unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would then be needed to convict and remove the president.)\\n\\nFox News\\' Ronn Blitzer and John Roberts and The Associated Press contributed to this report.',\n",

No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!\"\\n\\nTrump added: \"The Democrats are so focused on hurting the Republican Party and the President that they are unable to get anything done because of it, including legislation on gun safety, lowering of prescription drug prices, infrastructure, etc. So bad for our Country!\"\\n\\nDepartment of Justice lawyers, as well as lawyers at the White House, have been advising White House officials to release the transcript since last week, a source familiar with the conversations told Fox News.\\n\\nThe dramatic \"flip-the-script\" moment could blunt Democrats\\' newly energized push to begin a formal impeachment inquiry, based on a whistleblower\\'s allegation that the president pressed the new Ukrainian leader during the phone call to investigate the former vice president and his son Hunter.\\n\\nBut Democrats were sure to continue their push for the whistleblower\\'s full complaint and testimony, which could provide additional details. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Tuesday afternoon that testimony from the whistleblower might be imminent.\\n\\n\"We have been informed by the whistleblower’s counsel that their client would like to speak to our committee and has requested guidance from the Acting DNI [Director of National Intelligence] as to how to do so,\" Schiff said in a tweet. \"We‘re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower’s testimony as soon as this week.\"\\n\\nIt was unclear if Acting DNI Joseph Maguire would provide that guidance. Maguire is expected to testify himself before the House Intelligence Committee at an open hearing on Thursday -- but Maguire has refused to share some information, including the complaint.\\n\\nA source familiar with the matter told Fox News this week that the whistleblower did not have “firsthand knowledge” of the conversation between Trump and the Ukrainian president.\\n\\nAnd Yahoo News reported that the GOP-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee had written to the whistleblower\\'s attorney, requesting a bipartisan closed-door interview.\\n\\nAt the same time, the matter threatened to shine a harsh spotlight on the Bidens\\' activities in Ukraine, and top Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., warned the situation could \"backfire\" on Democrats.\\n\\n\"The longer we talk about what the Bidens did in Ukraine, the better,\" said Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser, who dismissed those who believe Trump will pay a political price for the latest controversy.\\n\\nJoe Biden has acknowledged that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board.\\n\\nTop Trump surrogates, including his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, have long said that Ukraine should investigate that matter fully.\\n\\nAnd Trump has long said he wants European countries to pay more for their own defense. An administration official told the Wall Street Journal that Trump\\'s actions on the call with Zelensky in July \"reflected the president’s concerns about how the U.S. is spending aid money and whether U.S. allies are adequately contributing.\"\\n\\nIn remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the aid money to Ukraine\\'s investigative actions.\\n\\n“No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said. But he also repeatedly called the Bidens\\' actions in Ukraine a \"disgrace,\" and added: “It’s very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?”\\n\\nStill, there were other indications that releasing the transcript would not fully satisfy the growing chorus of Democrats calling for an impeachment inquiry. In a statement on Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., strongly suggested that impeachment might be on the table if the whistleblower\\'s full complaint was not provided to Congress.\\n\\n\"If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,\" Pelosi said.\\n\\nShe was expected to get behind an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday.\\n\\nSeveral commentators also cast skepticism on Trump\\'s announcement within minutes.\\n\\n\"Nixon released his own transcripts of the Oval Office tapes — which turned out to be wildly misleading,\" said historian Kevin Cruse.\\n\\nAdded Politico correspondent Natasha Bertrand: \"Full transcript ≠ full whistleblower complaint.\"\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nMeanwhile, a slew of key swing-district Democrats late Monday threw their support en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry, as The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal reported in the evening that the president personally ordered acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before his phone call with the Ukrainian president.\\n\\nFox News\\' Jake Gibson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump repeatedly pushed for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate a potential 2020 political rival, Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter, during a July 25 phone call, according to a transcript of the conversation released by the White House.\\n\\nTrump also asked the Ukrainian leader to work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and US Attorney General William Barr on the issue, the call transcript reveals.\\n\\n\"There\\'s a lot of talk about Biden\\'s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me,\" Trump says, according to the document.\\n\\nThe release of the transcript showing Trump repeatedly pressed the Ukrainian leader to investigate a political rival comes a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared the President had betrayed his oath of office and announced she is opening a formal impeachment inquiry.\\n\\nTrump on Wednesday denied any wrongdoing, saying there was \"no pressure whatsoever\" in his phone call with Zelensky.\\n\\nAt an afternoon news conference in New York, the President added: \"I didn\\'t do it. There was no quid pro quo.\"\\n\\nThe rough transcript, which a senior White House official said was developed with assistance from voice recognition software along with note takers and experts listening, will likely amplify the Democratic impeachment effort.\\n\\n\"The fact is that the President of the United States, in breach of his constitutional responsibilities, has asked a foreign government to help him in his political campaign at the expense of our national security, as well as undermining the integrity of our elections,\" Pelosi said after the transcript was released Wednesday. \"That cannot stand. He will be held accountable. No one is above the law.\"\\n\\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff told reporters Wednesday that the President\\'s message to the Ukrainian President was clear, despite some debate over whether there was quid pro quo.\\n\\n\"There is no quid pro quo necessary to betray your country or your oath of office. Even though many read this as a quid pro quo. I\\'m not concerned whether it is a quid pro quo or not. Ukraine understood what this President wanted,\" the California Democrat said.\\n\\nThe July 25 call, which took place one day after former special counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress about Russian interference in US elections, was also part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, a source familiar with the situation previously told CNN, a revelation that has only raised more questions in the ongoing controversy.\\n\\nDuring the call, Trump suggested four times that Barr will call Zelensky and repeatedly mentions Giuliani, the Trump ally and former New York City mayor.\\n\\nGiuliani has long lobbied Ukraine to investigate Biden\\'s call in 2016 to remove the country\\'s top prosecutor, who at one point had been investigating a Ukrainian natural gas company connected to Hunter Biden.\\n\\nThere is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.\\n\\nOn the call, Zelensky agreed to the President\\'s request.\\n\\n\"Since we have won the absolute majority in our Parliament, the next prosecutor general will be 100% my person, my candidate,\" the Ukrainian president said. He later added: \"He or she will look into the situation specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue. The issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and will work on the investigation of the case.\"\\n\\nWednesday, the Ukranian leader said he did not feel pressured.\\n\\n\"Nobody pushed me,\" Zelensky said in a joint appearance with Trump.\\n\\nTrump said Wednesday evening that he\\'s willing to release a transcript of another call with the Ukrainian president.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll release that, too, if that\\'s important to you,\" Trump said of a call which preceded the one the public learned more about Wednesday through a newly released transcript. \"I spoke to him previous to the call that we released.\"\\n\\nHe reiterated that it was a \"very innocent\" call.\\n\\n\\'I would like you to do us a favor\\'\\n\\nPrior to mentioning Biden, Trump criticized Mueller\\'s testimony from the day prior and raised the possibility of looking into the US cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which has been retained by Democrats and Republicans in recent years.\\n\\nAfter getting hacked in 2016, the Democratic National Committee hired CrowdStrike to investigate the attacks. CrowdStrike publicly blamed the Russian government, which was later confirmed by Mueller\\'s investigation.\\n\\nThen, Zelensky mentioned that Ukraine is ready to buy more Javelin missiles from the US, prompting Trump\\'s reply, \"I would like you to do us a favor.\"\\n\\n\"I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike ... I guess you have one of your wealthy people ... The server, they say Ukraine has it,\" Trump told Zelensky according to the transcript.\\n\\n\"There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you\\'re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the attorney general call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it,\" he added. \"Whatever you can do, it\\'s very important that you do it if that\\'s possible.\"\\n\\nThere is no evidence Ukraine has the server Trump is referring to.\\n\\nTrump also told Zelensky the US has been \"very, very good\" to Ukraine.\\n\\n\"A lot of European countries are the same way, so I think it\\'s something you want to look at but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine. I wouldn\\'t say that it\\'s reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine,\" he said.\\n\\nZelensky agreed, and told Trump the US is a \"much bigger partner\" to Ukraine than other European countries regarding sanctions on Russia, adding that he planned to purchase more Javelin missiles from the United States.\\n\\nCriminal referral\\n\\nThe Justice Department also said Wednesday that it received a criminal referral from the Intelligence Community Inspector General in late August to investigate whether the President\\'s push for Ukraine to investigate Biden was a violation of campaign finance law.\\n\\nDOJ declined to bring a case because it found that asking the Ukrainians to investigate Biden was not something of monetary value, and therefore did not run afoul of campaign finance laws.\\n\\nThe Justice Department\\'s examination centered on the July call. Prosecutors interviewed White House officials involved in producing the transcript to establish it was a reliable record of the call. No other interviews were done. The FBI received a separate referral from the inspector general but deferred to the DOJ criminal division which was doing its analysis, according to a senior Justice Department official.\\n\\nBarr was also not recused from handling the issue despite the fact that his name comes up in Trump\\'s call with Zelensky.\\n\\nIn the ICIG\\'s assessment of the whistleblower complaint, they noted that \"some indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the complainant in favor of a rival political candidate.\" The ICIG still determined that the complaint was credible.\\n\\nBarr hasn\\'t spoken with Trump on Biden\\n\\nThe Justice Department says Barr has not spoken with Trump, the Ukrainian government or Giuliani about the Biden issue.\\n\\n\"The attorney general was first notified of the President\\'s conversation with Ukrainian President Zelensky several weeks after the call took place, when the Department of Justice learned of a potential referral. The President has not spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son,\" Department of Justice Spokesperson Kerri Kupec said in a statement Wednesday.\\n\\n\"The President has not asked the Attorney General to contact Ukraine -- on this or any other matter. The Attorney General has not communicated with Ukraine -- on this or any other subject. Nor has the Attorney General discussed this matter, or anything relating to Ukraine, with Rudy Giuliani,\" Kupec added.\\n\\nCongress reacts\\n\\nThe immediate reaction to the transcript from congressional lawmakers was largely split down party lines.\\n\\nTop Democrats have concluded it showed clear evidence of Trump pressuring a foreign leader for political advantage. Republicans immediately insisted -- as has Trump -- that there was no explicit quid pro quo in the call -- an argument that is likely to form the centerpiece of the anti-impeachment case.\\n\\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters that the transcript is \"pretty damning, in terms of the President trying to put pressure on a foreign government to interfere in our elections or to get dirt on his opponent,\" though he would not say if it contained evidence Trump committed an impeachable offense.\\n\\nPelosi however, asserted that the transcript only highlights the need for a formal impeachment inquiry.\\n\\n\"The transcript and the Justice Department\\'s acting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the President\\'s lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry. Clearly, the Congress must act,\" she said in a statement.\\n\\nDemocratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called the document a \"smoking gun.\\n\\n\"If this is the version of events the president\\'s team thinks is most favorable, he is in very deep jeopardy,\" Warren tweeted.\\n\\nThe Trump 2020 campaign was quick to unleash its own offensive, and several Republicans immediately came to the President\\'s defense.\\n\\nSen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said Democrats would be \"insane\" to impeach Trump over a telephone call.\\n\\nIowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley echoed that sentiment, underlining how the political terrain over the months-long impeachment fight to come is already being drawn.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve read the transcript in its entirety. It shows that there was no quid pro quo,\" Grassley said.\\n\\nThis story has been updated.',\n",

We all watched from the United States and you did a terrific job. The way you came from behind, somebody who wasn't given much of a chance, and you ended up winning easily. It's a fantastic achievement. Congratulations.\\n\\nPresident Zelenskyy: You are absolutely right Mr. President. We did win big and we worked hard for this. We worked a lot but I would like to confess to you that I had an opportunity to learn from you. We used quite a few of your skills and knowledge and were able to use it as an example for our elections and yes it is true that these were unique elections. We were in a unique situation that we were able to achieve a unique success. I'm able to tell you the following; the first time you called me to congratulate me when I won my presidential election, and the second time you are now calling me when my party won the parliamentary election. I think I should run more often so you can call me more often and we can talk over the phone more often.\\n\\nThe President: (laughter) That's a very good idea. I think your country is very happy about that.\\n\\nPresident Zelenskyy: Well yes, to tell you the truth, we are trying to work hard because we wanted to drain the swamp here in our country. We brought in many many new people. Not the old politicians, not the typical politicians, because we want to have a new format and a new type of government. You are a great teacher for us and in that.\\n\\nThe President: Well it is very nice of you to say that. I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are. Germany does almost nothing for you. All they do is talk and I think it's something that you should really ask them about. When I was speaking to Angela Merkel she talks Ukraine, but she ·doesn't do anything. A lot of the European countries are the same way so I think it's something you want to look at but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine. I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine.\\n\\nPresident Zelenskyy: Yes you are absolutely right. Not only 100%, but actually 1000% and I can tell you the following; I did talk to Angela Merkel and I did meet with her I also met and talked with Macron and I told them that they are not doing quite as much as they need to be doing on the issues with the sanctions. They are not enforcing the sanctions. They are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine. It turns out that even though logically, the European Union should be our biggest partner but technically the United States is a much bigger partner than the European Union and I'm very grateful to you for that because the United States is doing quite a lot for Ukraine. Much more than the European Union especially when we are talking about sanctions against the Russian Federation. I would also like to thank you for your great support in the area of defense. We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps specifically we are almost. ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.\\n\\nThe President: I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you're surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it's very important that you do it if that's possible.\\n\\nPresident Zelenskyy: Yes it is very important for me and everything that you just mentioned earlier. For me as a President, it is very important and we are open for any future cooperation. We are ready to open a new page on cooperation in relations between the United States and Ukraine. For that purpose, I just recalled our ambassador from United States and he will be replaced by a very competent and very experienced ambassador who will work hard on making sure that our two nations are getting closer. I would also like and hope to see him having your trust and your confidence and have personal relations with you so we can cooperate even more so. I will personally tell you that one of my assistants spoke with Mr. Giuliani just recently and we are hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to Ukraine. I just wanted to assure you once again that you have nobody but friends around us. I will make sure that I surround myself with the best and most experienced people. I also wanted to tell you that we are friends. We are great friends and you Mr. President have friends in our country so we can continue our strategic partnership. I also plan to surround myself with great people and in addition to that investigation, I guarantee as the President of Ukraine that all the investigations will be done openly and candidly.. That I can assure you.\\n\\nThe President: Good because I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that's really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved. Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what's happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great. The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let you know that. The other thing, There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me.\\n\\nPresident Zelenskyy: I wanted to tell you about the prosecutor. First of all, I understand and I'm knowledgeable about the situation. Since we have won the absolute majority in our Parliament, the next prosecutor general will be 100% my person, my candidate, who will be approved, by the parliament and will start as a new prosecutor in September. He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue. The issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and will work on the investigation of the case. On top of that, I would kindly ask you if you have any additional information that you can provide to us, it would be very helpful for the investigation to make sure that we administer justice in our country with regard to the Ambassador to the United States from Ukraine as far as I recall her name was Ivanovich. It was great that you were the first one who told me that she was a bad ambassador because I agree with you 100%. Her attitude towards me was far from the best as she admired the previous President and she was on his side. She would not accept me as a new President well enough.\\n\\nThe President: Well, she's going to go through some things. I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it. I'm sure you will figure it out. I heard the prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor so good luck with everything. Your economy is going to get better and better I predict. You have a lot of assets. It's a great country. I have many Ukrainian friends, their incredible people.\\n\\nPresident Zelenskyy: I would like to tell you that I also have quite a few Ukrainian friends that live in the United States. Actually last time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park and I stayed at the Trump Tower. I will talk to them and I hope to see them again in the future. I also wanted to thank you for your invitation to visit the United States, specifically Washington DC. On the other hand, I also want to ensure you that we will be very serious about the case and will work on the investigation. As to the economy, there is much potential for our two countries and one of the issues that is very important for Ukraine is energy independence. I believe we can be very successful and cooperating on energy independence with United States. We are already working on cooperation. We are buying American oil but I am very hopeful for a future meeting. We will have more time and more opportunities to discuss these opportunities and get to know each other better. I would like to thank you very much for your support.\\n\\nThe President: Good. Well, thank you very much and I appreciate that. I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call. Thank you. Whenever you would like to come to the White House, feel free to call. Give us a date and we'll work that out. I look forward to seeing you.\\n\\nPresident Zelenskyy: Thank you very much. I would be very happy to come and would be happy to meet with you personally and get to know you better. I am looking forward to our meeting and I also would like to invite you to visit Ukraine and come to the city of Kyiv which is a beautiful city. We have a beautiful country which would welcome you. On the other hand, I believe that on September 1 we will be in Poland and we can meet in Poland hopefully. After that, it might be a very good idea for you to travel to Ukraine. We can either take my plane and go to Ukraine or we can take your plane, which is probably much better than mine.\\n\\nThe President: Okay, we can work that out. I look forward to seeing you in Washington and maybe in Poland because I think we are going to be there at that time.\\n\\nPresident Zelenskyy: Thank you very much Mr. President.\\n\\nThe President: Congratulations on a fantastic job you've done. The whole world was watching. I'm not sure it was so much of an upset but congratulations.\\n\\nPresident Zelenskyy: Thank you Mr. President bye-bye.\\n\\n- - End of conversation - -\",\n",

       "  'text': 'New York (CNN) President Donald Trump was incredulous Tuesday as he sat in Trump Tower and watched House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announce she was launching a formal impeachment inquiry against him, sources familiar with the moment say. Sitting in the same building where he launched his long shot presidential campaign four years ago, Trump said he couldn\\'t believe it, he later told people.\\n\\nHe had felt confident after phoning Pelosi earlier that morning. The drive for impeachment in her caucus had ramped up amid reports he pushed the Ukrainian President to investigate Joe Biden , and Trump was hoping to head off a clash. He figured he could de-escalate tensions by speaking with her directly.\\n\\nIt was after that call that Trump made the decision to release an \"unredacted\" version of the transcript of his July call -- against the advice of aides such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who warned him it would set a risky precedent. Trump wanted to undercut the argument from Democrats that he acted inappropriately, he said, and felt he had nothing to hide.\\n\\nBut when the announcement he would release the transcript did little to quell the growing calls for his impeachment, Trump was in disbelief.\\n\\nDemocrats immediately argued that it wouldn\\'t be enough. They also wanted to see the whistleblower\\'s complaint , which had been found urgent and credible by the inspector general for the intelligence community and was mandated by law to be handed over to the intelligence committees. Administration officials began working out a plan to declassify and redact the complaint so it could be turned over too, all in the hope of easing escalated tensions with lawmakers.\\n\\nRead More',\n",

       "  'text': 'New York (CNN) Vice President Mike Pence was not supposed to be in Poland.\\n\\nNevertheless, on September 1, there he was, leaning over a vase of white flowers to listen as the Ukrainian President vowed to \"beat corruption\" and enact new reforms.\\n\\nPence was filling in for his boss, President Donald Trump, who days earlier scrapped his trip to Warsaw -- and with it, his first planned meeting with the new Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky -- to monitor a hurricane bearing down on the southeastern coast.\\n\\nNow, Pence finds himself among the numerous administration officials thrust into the middle of another controversy involving the President and foreign political influence, a familiar but uncomfortable predicament for many of Trump\\'s associates as they near the three-year-mark of a scandal-plagued presidency.\\n\\nOver the course of the past five months, US officials have raised corruption issues with Zelensky and his aides repeatedly as they took measure of a new leader in a country long plagued by crooked government and pay-for-play politics.\\n\\nBut, because of public and private urging from Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, officials also reckoned with how to raise allegations involving the son of Vice President Joe Biden, who held a board position at a Ukrainian energy company and Trump insisted should be investigated. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.\\n\\nThe issue exploded this week as Trump sought to bolster his foreign agenda at the United Nations. In nearly every photo opportunity, he confronted questions about the issue, including whether it was related to his decision to temporarily withhold US military aid.\\n\\nDefiant, Trump sought to explain his decision as a desire to force Europe to pay more. In explaining himself, however, Trump brought his various underlings to the fray.\\n\\n\"I made that loud and clear. I told that to Mick Mulvaney, I told it to a lot of people -- where\\'s Mick? -- wherever he is,\" Trump said, referring to his acting chief of staff.\\n\\n\"I told it to a lot of different people. I told it to Mike, I told it to -- two Mikes. I told it to Steve. I said it to Wilbur Ross,\" he added, referencing his vice president and Secretaries of State, Treasury and Commerce. \"I keep asking the same question. Why is it that the United States is always paying these foreign countries?\"\\n\\nIt\\'s a familiar complaint that nonetheless has taken new life this week amid revelations Trump repeatedly raised the issue of Biden and his son in a late-July phone call with Zelensky. That has spurred Democrats to open formal impeachment proceedings and has raised questions about who in the administration was privy to Trump\\'s decision-making as the events in question unfolded.\\n\\nAsked this week about the controversy, Trump\\'s Cabinet aides have sought to turn the blame back on Biden and shrugged off suggestions of impropriety.\\n\\n\"He mentioned Vice President Biden and his son in the context of us wanting to see honest government,\" Pence said in an interview on Fox News. \"That\\'s exactly what the American taxpayer would expect.\"\\n\\nEvaluating a new leader\\n\\nStill, before the call took place, administration officials and Trump allies had spent months taking stock of the new Ukrainian leader.\\n\\nTrump first spoke with Zelensky by phone in April, shortly after his election, to congratulate him on his victory. In a description of that call, the White House said Trump did raise a desire to \"root out corruption\" in Ukraine -- a key issue that the White House readout of the July phone call did not include.\\n\\nIn the ensuing months, officials worked to make inroads with Zelensky\\'s administration, including then-National Security Adviser John Bolton and the US Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker.\\n\\nAt the same time, Giuliani was embarking upon his effort to convince Kiev to investigate Hunter Biden and his business dealings in Ukraine -- an effort that quickly caught the attention of the President.\\n\\nTrump himself was not initially interested in engaging with Zelensky, officials familiar with the matter said. Instead, he viewed Ukraine was a corrupt country that wasn\\'t committed to reform, according to people familiar with his thinking at the time.\\n\\nHis phone call -- and a planned meeting with Zelensky on Wednesday -- came after months of back-and-forth between Trump and his advisers, who have worked to convince him that engaging the new Ukrainian leader is worth his time and effort for national security reasons.\\n\\nDuring a meeting between Zelensky and Volker in early July -- ahead of Trump\\'s second phone call with the Ukrainian President -- Zelensky referenced Giuliani in a joking manner, according to a source familiar with the discussion.\\n\\nThe Biden allegations were not central to that discussion, which took place in Toronto, as it mainly focused on how to urge the Ukrainians to make positive policy decisions -- namely in rooting out corruption, and dealing with the Russians.\\n\\nGiuliani\\'s role\\n\\nAs the US laid out those priorities, Zelensky joked about the hardship of getting lawyers involved. That\\'s when he playfully referenced Giuliani, acknowledging that his Trump administration interlockers where not responsible for the President\\'s persistent personal attorney.\\n\\nAccording to press reports, Volker said on the sidelines of the meetings that Ukraine has a \"judiciary that has been subject to political influences from various directions for a long time\" -- an allusion to the corruption issues that American officials have long encouraged Ukraine to solve.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t long before Ukrainian officials visited Washington for key meetings at the White House, State Department and Pentagon, which ultimately led up to Trump\\'s July 25 phone call.\\n\\nPeople familiar with the matter said Bolton and other US officials who met with the senior Ukrainian official in early July did not discuss the Biden matter, either. But the issue was known, and colored the talks.\\n\\n\"That was a bizarre situation, but it all seemed to be dealt with in Giuliani track,\" a person familiar with the meetings said. \"It was out there, but it was being handled by Giuliani. We did not deal with that because he (Giuliani) was talking about it and saying he was a private citizen.\"\\n\\nIn the following weeks, it was Volker who helped arrange a meeting between Giuliani and a Zelensky aide, during which the former New York City mayor encouraged an investigation into the Biden issue. Volker connected the aide with Giuliani at the request of Zelensky\\'s presidential adviser, the State Department said. The request was a markedly different approach than Zelensky laughing off Giuliani\\'s role just weeks before.\\n\\nVolker was intent on trying to get the Biden issue off the table, the person familiar with the matter said, eager to remove the issue from bilateral conversations between the US and Ukraine. His steps toward arranging the meeting between Giuliani and a Zelensky aide were meant to hand the issue off to a non-government interlocutor so that administration officials could focus on the many other issues between the countries.\\n\\nBut given that Trump himself had raised the Biden matter with Zelensky in his July 25 phone call, he inserted it squarely in the middle of the US-Ukraine relationship.\\n\\nVague answers\\n\\nWhile Volker, a State Department official, facilitated that meeting, Pompeo would not address the role his department played in a round of interviews on Sunday. Pompeo also declined to give a direct answer when asked if he had ever asked Zelensky to open an investigation into Biden or not. Instead, he spoke in vague terms about the US-Ukraine official dialogue.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve talked to the foreign minister now a couple of times. We talk about the important relationship between our two countries and how we can make Ukraine stronger and have great economic commerce between our two great nations,\" Pompeo said.\\n\\nBy the time Pence was sitting in a Warsaw hotel conference room across from Zelensky in September, an intelligence whistleblower had already filed a complaint centered on Trump\\'s behavior toward Ukraine.\\n\\nA day later, Pence was questioned by reporters whether the issue involving Biden\\'s son arose in his meeting. He said it did not -- but quickly turned to the issue of corruption.\\n\\n\"As President Trump had me make clear, we have great concerns about issues of corruption. And, fortunately, President Zelensky was elected decisively on an anti-corruption message,\" Pence said, adding later: \"To invest additional taxpayer in Ukraine, the President wants to be assured that those resources are truly making their way to the kind of investments that will contribute to security and stability in Ukraine. And that\\'s an expectation the American people have and the President has expressed very clearly.\"\\n\\nZelensky, meanwhile, is visiting the United States just as his conversations with Trump prompt a historic political crisis.\\n\\nHe seemed unfazed on Tuesday.\\n\\n\"I expect us to have awesome relations with the United States. I expect us to invite Donald Trump to visit Ukraine. I would like the leaders of the countries to come and see how great Ukraine is. One should believe not the words, but the eyes,\" he said in a Facebook video.\\n\\nAsked by CNN later if it was his understanding that the aid for Ukraine and investigation into the Bidens was linked, Zelensky simply responded that his conversations with the President are \"private and confidential.\"\\n\\nWhen asked if he wanted the transcript of the call to be released, Zelensky said only: \"We\\'ll see.\"',\n",

He then makes clear that the US does a lot more for Ukraine than Ukraine does for the US.\\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t say that it\\'s reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine.\"\\n\\n3. Trump directly asks Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\\n\\n\"There\\'s a lot of talk about Biden\\'s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me.\"\\n\\n4. He suggests that Zelensky should talk to his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General Bill Barr.\\n\\n\"I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it.\"\\n\\n5. And then Trump reiterates that suggestion\\n\\n\"I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call.\"\\n\\nSo, in sum: The President of the United States tells a foreign leader that we do a lot for his country and his country hasn\\'t done enough for us. Then he says that it would be super nice if Ukraine looked into allegations -- debunked by all independent fact checkers and there is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden, it\\'s worth noting -- that his main rival in the 2020 race did some unethical things in the country. Because, he asserts, it sounds \"horrible\" to him. And then reiterates -- several times! -- that the Ukrainian president needs to talk to his personal lawyer and his administration\\'s attorney general about all of this.\\n\\nAre you kidding me? And reminder, this isn\\'t even really a transcript of their call. As the document notes: \"The text in this document records the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty Officers and NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place. A number of factors can affect the accuracy of the record, including poor telecommunications connections and variations in accent and/or interpretation.\"\\n\\nEven if Trump hadn\\'t openly asked Zelensky to look into Biden and instead only suggested that he had heard rumors of corruption regarding the Bidens and Ukraine, this call would be problematic. Because the United States is a global superpower which was, at that moment, withholding loan money from Ukraine -- a fact that the newly elected president of said country would be intimately aware of. That Trump just came out and asked for Zelensky to investigate the Bidens -- after reminding him several times of how much the US did for Ukraine!!!! -- is something very close to the textbook definition of a quid pro quo.\\n\\nTake it out of the context of politics. Let\\'s say you are a small business owner who has seen an uptick in business thanks to a series of referrals coming to you via a much larger company. And the CEO of that much larger company calls you and says something like \"We are doing a lot of good for your bottom line, right? More than you are doing for us. So, hey, our biggest competitor is apparently doing some pretty nasty things with their workers. You should really look into that.\"\\n\\nNow the larger company CEO didn\\'t come out and say, \"Hey, do this muckraking of our main competitor or else your pipeline gets cut off by us,\" right? But unless your brain stem has somehow disconnected from your brain, you know exactly what is being asked here. Do this, or else.\\n\\nIt\\'s hard to imagine why Trump, knowing what he said, would have spent the past 48 hours defending the call as \"perfect\" and totally above board. The actual transcript makes that pre-spin laughable.\\n\\n\"It ended up being a nothing call,\" Trump said in the wake of the release of the transcript on Wednesday morning.\\n\\nBut what is documented, very clearly, in this kind-of, sort-of transcript is this: The American President pressuring a foreign leader to look into the frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. And doing it by reminding the Ukrainian President of all the US has done for his country.\\n\\nThe transcript is truly stunning stuff -- even from a President who has moved the goalposts on \"stunning\" a long time ago. If Trump thought releasing this transcript would somehow make Democrats look like fools for beginning an impeachment inquiry against him, he was wrong. Very, very wrong.',\n",

       "  'authors': ['Joan Biskupic'],\n",
       "  'text': '(CNN) As President Donald Trump tries to elude oversight in Congress for his actions, including recent dealings with Ukraine, Trump\\'s personal lawyers have made a far-reaching claim that could remove a judicial check on a president\\'s alleged transgressions.\\n\\nTrump\\'s lawyers have argued in a federal case to be heard Wednesday that the Constitution shields the president from any criminal investigation -- not just from actual prosecution -- while he holds office.\\n\\nAmong their legal justifications, Trump lawyers quote a 2009 law review essay written by now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh that declared: \"Even the lesser burdens of a criminal investigation -- including preparing for questioning by criminal investigators -- are time-consuming and distracting. ... [C]riminal investigations take the President\\'s focus away from his or her responsibilities to the people. And a President who is concerned about an ongoing criminal investigation is almost inevitably going to do a worse job as President.\"\\n\\nIn the 1990s, Kavanaugh was on independent counsel Ken Starr\\'s team that spurred the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. But Kavanaugh, who Trump nominated to the bench last year, said that after he worked for President George W. Bush, he saw the need to protect the presidency from the criminal process.\\n\\nIt is difficult to predict how Kavanaugh and fellow conservative justices who constitute the majority on the US Supreme Court would rule on Trump\\'s assertion of complete immunity from the criminal process. But accepting it would defy court precedent and basic constitutional principles.\\n\\n\"The government was founded in resistance to a king who claimed absolute power. The Constitution was framed so that no one person, even the president, is above the law,\" said University of Georgia constitutional law professor Diane Marie Amann.\\n\\nWith House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\\'s announcement Tuesday of a formal impeachment inquiry, Trump appears to face the greatest threat right now from the US House of Representatives. But history has demonstrated that litigation against a president can be of significant consequences. It was a court decision requiring President Richard Nixon to turn over Oval Office tapes incriminating him in the Watergate scandal that ultimately ended his presidency.\\n\\nThe Trump case to be heard Wednesday in New York arises from the President\\'s effort to block a state grand jury subpoena for records from his accounting firm Mazars USA. The New York District Attorney is investigating hush-money payments made to two women who claimed they had affairs with Trump before he was president.\\n\\nA separate case, arising from a House subpoena against Mazars is pending in a federal appeals court in Washington, DC. The Department of Justice is largely siding with Trump\\'s personal lawyers in that lawsuit, and last month filed a \"friend of the court\" brief arguing that the House may not authorize a subpoena unless it can cite a specific legislative purpose.\\n\\nAmann and other legal scholars say they doubt Trump\\'s attempt to elude all subpoenas would succeed at the high court.\\n\\nThese are unpredictable, unsettled times in national politics, as well as within the federal judiciary. Chief Justice John Roberts has a record of high regard for executive branch prerogatives. He is among the majority of current justices who served in the executive branch early in their career. Yet the chief justice has also made plain his larger concern to keep the judiciary out of the volatile politicization that has seized the country and taken steps to separate himself from Trump.\\n\\nNYC case\\n\\nAs Trump has continually defied the Democratic-led US House of Representatives, he has simultaneously sought greater influence in the Third Branch, including through \"us versus them\" tweets differentiating between his judicial appointees and those of Democratic presidents.\\n\\nIn the case to be heard Wednesday in the southern district of New York, Trump is trying to staunch part of the judicial process. He is suing the New York County District Attorney\\'s office to kill a grand jury subpoena for tax returns and other financial documents from Mazars.\\n\\nDistrict Attorney Cy Vance is investigating so-called hush money paid to women who alleged affairs with Trump. Vance is pursuing whether the Trump Organization violated New York state law regarding reimbursement for the payoffs to former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen.\\n\\nAsking a federal judge to prevent the New York subpoena, Trump\\'s lawyers wrote, \"The U.S. Constitution ... prohibits the District Attorney from criminally investigating, prosecuting, or indicting the President while he is in office.\"\\n\\nThey point to the President\\'s core powers under Article II of the Constitution and the Supremacy Clause.\\n\\nThey contend history is on their side: \"The Framers of our Constitution understood that state and local prosecutors would be tempted to criminally investigate the President to advance their own careers and to advance their political agendas. And they likewise understood that having to defend against these actions would distract the President from his constitutional duties.\"\\n\\nIn a response filed Monday, Vance\\'s team contended that \"no such sweeping immunity\" exists for a sitting president. It noted that the subpoena was directed at the Mazars and should not interfere with the President\\'s executive responsibilities.\\n\\nProsecutors also referred to multiple state and federal investigations that have already centered on the President, including special counsel Robert Mueller\\'s probe into election interference and obstruction of justice. Mueller, in fact, found that a sitting President could not be criminally charged, based on decades-old Department of Justice rules, but a President could be investigated.\\n\\nTrump\\'s team has deemed the Vance effort a political exercise more than anything, calling the subpoena \"a bad faith effort to harass the President by obtaining and exposing his confidential financial information, not a legitimate attempt to enforce New York law.\"\\n\\nThe US House lawsuit was heard in July by a panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and a ruling is expected any day. Trump is appealing a decision by US District Court Judge Amit Mehta in May rejecting Trump\\'s arguments.\\n\\n\"It is simply not fathomable,\" Mehta wrote, \"that a Constitution that grants Congress the power to remove a President for reasons including criminal behavior would deny Congress the power to investigate him for unlawful conduct -- past or present -- even without formally opening an impeachment inquiry.\"\\n\\nNixon and Clinton\\n\\nUnlike disputes over Trump administration policy that began immediately in January 2017 when the new President imposed a travel ban -- and have found the Supreme Court largely deferring to Trump -- cases testing his personal business dealings have not yet reached the nine justices.\\n\\nThe DC Circuit dispute over the House subpoena for Mazars USA and a separate New York-based Second Circuit case arising from the House\\'s effort to obtain financial records from Deutsche Bank for Trump, his children and Trump-family controlled entities are the farthest along.\\n\\nIn a separate series of complaints, the 2nd Circuit earlier this month revived an ethics lawsuit against Trump that contends his hotel and other business interests violate the Constitution\\'s Emoluments Clause, which prevents the President from accepting gifts from foreign governments without the permission of Congress. The 4th Circuit, conversely, has rejected an Emoluments-related lawsuit brought by the District of Columbia and Maryland against Trump in his personal capacity for possible conflicts of interest.\\n\\nThe DC Circuit will take up a third case on the issue, testing whether Democratic members of Congress can pursue their lawsuit against Trump for failing to allow Congress to review and vote on his business interests\\n\\nTrump has refused to follow the usual presidential practice of divesting personal business interests once in office, and he has so far successfully prevented any collection of evidence in the lawsuits regarding the constitutionality of his business holdings.\\n\\nIn the tax-records case to be heard Wednesday by US District Court Judge Victor Marrero, Trump\\'s lawyers acknowledge that no prior cases directly bolster the Trump position, and they minimize the reach of cases that subjected Presidents Nixon and Clinton to investigation.\\n\\nIn the 1974 Nixon case arising from a subpoena for Oval Office tapes related to the Watergate scandal, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected an assertion of executive privilege. The justices said the need for evidence in a pending criminal trial overrode the President\\'s assertion that he had a constitutional right to keep communications private. After being forced to turn over the incriminating tape recordings, Nixon resigned.\\n\\nMore than two decades later, in 1997, the Supreme Court ruled that Clinton could not invoke presidential immunity to postpone a civil lawsuit by Paula Jones, who said Clinton had sexually harassed her when he was governor of Arkansas. The next year, in 1998, Starr obtained a subpoena to compel Clinton\\'s testimony in a separate matter involving Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern with whom Clinton had had an affair.\\n\\nWhen Clinton agreed to the interview, Starr withdrew the subpoena.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington (CNN) He smeared Joe Biden. He smeared Ilhan Omar. He smeared San Francisco. He denied the existence of an obvious delay in military aid to Ukraine. He denied that the name of the Democratic Party is the Democratic Party. He confused champion mountain climbers by claiming that champion mountain climbers had tried and failed to climb his border wall.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump made 79 false claims last week, mixing some fresh false accusations and pointlessly false anecdotes into his usual stew of repeat favorites.\\n\\nSeventy-nine false claims is down from 90 the week prior to last , Trump\\'s highest total since we started counting at CNN on July 8, but it was still his fourth-most-dishonest of these 11 weeks. His weekly average since July 8 is now 59 false claims.\\n\\nTrump made 29 of last week\\'s 79 false claims at his campaign rally in New Mexico. He made 13 more in his White House meeting and press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, seven on Twitter. The rest came in a smattering of events, interviews and exchanges with reporters.\\n\\nTwenty-seven of the false claims were about the economy, 15 about Democrats.\\n\\nThe most egregious false claim: The Ukraine delay\\n\\nFacing difficult questions about why he delayed military aid to Ukraine, Trump and his allies have tested out a variety of possible explanations. At one point last week, though, Trump decided to just deny the very existence of the delay.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t delay anything,\" he told reporters . \"We paid the military aid, to the best of my knowledge.\"\\n\\nThe money was paid, but that payment very clearly came after a delay. By this week, Trump was openly defending the delay he had said did not happen.\\n\\n\"I\\'d withhold again and I\\'ll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine, because they\\'re not doing it,\" he said -- which is also not true.\\n\\nThe most revealing false claim: Maligning Omar, again\\n\\nThis time, Trump amplified a tweet from a conservative commentator, Terrence K. Williams. Posting a video of Omar dancing, Williams accused her of partying on the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\\n\\nThe most absurd false claim: The name of the Democratic Party\\n\\nFor sheer weirdness, it is hard to top Trump\\'s story about the mountain climbers and the border wall. But we say his claim about the Democratic Party did it.\\n\\nSome of Trump\\'s false claims are so bizarre that it\\'s almost embarrassing to check them. When you do, some of his supporters will inevitably accuse you of humorlessness or pettiness.\\n\\nWhatever: this is a comprehensive tally, and we must do our solemn duty. Thus, we must point out that ... the name of the Democratic Party is the Democratic Party.\\n\\nWe must do so because Trump has repeatedly and solemnly insisted that the actual name is the \"Democrat Party.\"\\n\\nHe said last week, again, that he is not only using \"Democrat Party\" because it sounds worse but because that is the party\\'s official name. He urged the Democrats to make a change to the nicer \"Democratic Party,\" in which case he might call them that.\\n\\nYes, he might just be trolling. No, that does not make any of this less confusing.\\n\\nHere is a list of false claims from last week that we had not previously fact checked in a weekly update:\\n\\nGoogle and the 2016 election\\n\\n\"Did you see Google?

It was beyond an offer. It was something where he said, \\'I\\'m not going to give billions of dollars to Ukraine unless they remove this prosecutor.\\' And they removed the prosecutor supposedly in one hour. And the prosecutor was prosecuting the company of the son and the son.\" -- September 22 exchange with reporters after Coast Guard briefing in Houston\\n\\nFacts First: There is no public evidence that Hunter Biden was ever himself under investigation.\\n\\nThe investigation, as far as we know, was into the business activities of Mykola Zlochevsky, who owned a natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, for which Hunter Biden had sat on the board of directors since 2014. The United Kingdom had begun investigating Zlochevsky before Hunter Biden joined the board.\\n\\n\"Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws -- at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,\" Shokin\\'s successor as prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Bloomberg.\\n\\nYou can read a full fact check on Trump\\'s claims about the Bidens and Ukraine here\\n\\nJoe Biden and \"the case\"\\n\\n\"Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden\\'s statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he\\'s not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case. So, somebody ought to look into that.\" -- September 20 exchange with reporters at meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison\\n\\nFacts First: There is no evidence that Biden ever called on Ukraine to remove its chief prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, from a case involving Mykola Zlochevsky, the owner of a natural gas company on whose board of directors Biden\\'s son Hunter Biden sat. Rather, Biden, like the US government more broadly and several US allies, tried to get Shokin fired.\\n\\nTrump\\'s allies might argue that calling for a prosecutor\\'s firing was even worse than calling for him to be taken off a particular case. But there is a key difference given the context.\\n\\nHad Biden called for Shokin to be taken off a particular matter in which his son had a stake, this would seem to suggest that his motivation was helping his son. But Biden calling for Shokin\\'s firing, without mentioning that particular case, was consistent with the international concern about Shokin\\'s performance.\\n\\nYou can read a full fact check on Trump\\'s claims about the Bidens and Ukraine here\\n\\nJoe Biden\\'s previous comments\\n\\n\"This is a very dishonest thing that Joe Biden did. And then he said he never spoke to this son. Does anybody believe that one? But then he also said, long before, that that he did speak to his son. So he lied, again.\" And: \"I mean, give me a break, he\\'s already said he spoke to his son. And now he said, yesterday, very firmly. Who wouldn\\'t speak to your son? Of course, you spoke to your son. So, he made the mistake of saying he never spoke to his son. He spoke to his son.\" -- September 22 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure\\n\\nFacts First: Biden has not previously said that he did speak to his son about his overseas business dealings. Rather, it was Hunter Biden who said that there was a conversation on the subject, according to a New Yorker : Biden has not previously said that he did speak to his son about his overseas business dealings. Rather, it was Hunter Biden who said that there was a conversation on the subject, according to a New Yorker article in July.\\n\\nThat article said this: \"As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: \\'Dad said, \"I hope you know what you are doing,\" and I said, \"I do.\\'\"\\n\\nOnce is more than never, so Trump can fairly point out the contradiction -- though the New Yorker article did not offer evidence that the father-son exchange was detailed. Regardless, the elder Biden was not contradicting himself; he was contradicting his son.\\n\\nYou can read a full fact check on Trump\\'s claims about the Bidens and Ukraine here\\n\\nCokie Roberts\\n\\n\"I never met her. She never treated me nicely. But I would like to wish her family well. She was a professional, and I respect professionals. I respect you guys a lot, you people a lot. She was a real professional. Never treated me well, but I certainly respect her as a professional.\" -- September 17 exchange with reporters on Air Force One\\n\\nFacts First: Trump had met Roberts, who : Trump had met Roberts, who died on September 17. As CNN\\'s Brian Stelter noted , she interviewed him at Trump Tower for a story that aired on ABC in December 1999. (Roberts also questioned him by phone during the 2016 campaign; she asked him asked about children using his campaign rhetoric to bully other children. He called the question \"very nasty.\")\\n\\nTrump, who has been interviewed many hundreds of times, could well have just forgotten the 1999 meeting, but his statement was false regardless of his intent.\\n\\nSan Francisco, the ocean and needles\\n\\n\"We\\'ll start with those two cities and we\\'re looking at San Francisco, we\\'re looking at Los Angeles. And we\\'re looking at all of the things that are happening. You know, there\\'s tremendous pollution being put into the ocean, because they\\'re going through what\\'s called a storm sewer. That\\'s for rainwater. And we have tremendous things that we don\\'t have to discuss pouring into the ocean. There are needles, there are other things. Lot of bad -- lot of -- it\\'s a terrible situation. That\\'s in Los Angeles and in San Francisco. And we\\'re going to be giving San Francisco -- they\\'re in total violation -- we\\'re going to be giving them the notice very soon.\" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One\\n\\nFacts First: There is no evidence for Trump\\'s claim that San Francisco has significant pollution, including needles, being sent into the ocean through storm sewers.\\n\\nSan Francisco Mayor London Breed called Trump\\'s claims \"ridiculous,\" saying in a statement that the city\\'s sewer system \"ensures that all debris that flow into storm drains are filtered out at the city\\'s wastewater treatment plants.\" David Lewis, executive director of nonprofit Save the Bay, told the Mercury News: \"In San Francisco, all solids in that stormwater and sewage water are removed. And what comes out of the plant is sometimes cleaner than the water that many people in this state are drinking.\"\\n\\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reported : \"Storm drain runoff is piped to one of two city treatment facilities, the Southeast Treatment Plant in the Bayview neighborhood or the Oceanside Treatment Plant near the zoo. Any pollutants would be treated at those points if they haven\\'t already been filtered out at catch basins beneath city streets, according to the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. \\'We haven\\'t had any (recent) problems with syringes,\\' said SFPUC spokesman Tyler Gamble.\"\\n\\nMountain climbers and the wall\\n\\n\"We actually built prototypes and we have, I guess you could say, world-class mountain climbers. We got climbers. We had 20 mountain climbers. That\\'s all they do; they love to climb mountains. They can have it. Me, I don\\'t want to climb mountains. But they\\'re very good. And some of them were champions. And we gave them different prototypes of walls, and this was the one that was hardest to climb.\" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit\\n\\nFacts First: There is no evidence that 20 mountain climbers, or any number of champion mountain climbers, were recruited to test Trump\\'s border barriers. When The Daily Beast : There is no evidence that 20 mountain climbers, or any number of champion mountain climbers, were recruited to test Trump\\'s border barriers. When The Daily Beast contacted several top mountain climbers and governing body USA Climbing, nobody had any idea what Trump was talking about. Customs and Border Protection refused to comment to CNN, referring questions to the White House.\\n\\nThe wall and San Diego\\n\\n\"You know in San Diego, California, is very difficult, always complaining, not doing great, but they wanted a wall in San Diego -- good mayor in San Diego, by the way. They wanted a wall, and I said, \\'You know what, let\\'s build it someplace else, because California, you know, once we build it, they\\'ll complain.\\'\" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico\\n\\nFacts First: It is possible that someone or some group from San Diego told him they wanted a wall, but as we : It is possible that someone or some group from San Diego told him they wanted a wall, but as we reported at the Toronto Star, there is no basis for Trump\\'s repeated suggestion that the city itself wanted a wall.

We realize this is a strange-sounding fact check, but Trump has repeatedly insisted that the actual name is the Democrat Party, so we are not going to let it slide.\\n\\nA tweet on Ilhan Omar\\n\\nTrump shared a tweet from comedian and conservative commentator Terrence K. Williams, who alleged that Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar was dancing on the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In his own comment above Williams\\' tweet, which Williams later deleted, Trump wrote , \"IIhan Omar, a member of AOC Plus 3, will win us the Great State of Minnesota. The new face of the Democrat Party!\" -- September 18 tweet\\n\\nFacts First: The footage of Omar dancing was from September 13, 2019, not the anniversary of September 11.

They just gave out a tremendous contract. You know what it\\'s for? They\\'re building a big wall around the building, they\\'re building a big wall, a massive wall.\" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico\\n\\nFacts First: There is no evidence that the Democrats are planning to erect a big wall around the convention site. \"It\\'s not true,\" Democratic National Committee spokesman Brandon Gassaway told CNN.\\n\\nThere will likely be some sort of security fencing in the vicinity of the convention, as is standard, but there are no known plans for a wall even slightly resembling the steel-and-concrete structure Trump visited in California.\\n\\nThe Green New Deal and cars\\n\\nTrump said that, under the Democrats\\' Green New Deal proposal, people would be limited to one car: \"Now, under the Green New Deal that (energy revenue) all goes away, that all goes away.

The Bay of Pigs award.\" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico\\n\\nFacts First: Trump got an endorsement, not an award, from the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association. The : Trump got an endorsement, not an award, from the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association. The endorsement was the first the association had ever made in a presidential election, so Trump could fairly boast about it. But still, an award and an endorsement are different things. (Trump claimed in August to have received an award from the Log Cabin Republicans, which told CNN it gave him an endorsement but not an award.)\\n\\nTrump\\'s Cuban American support in 2016\\n\\n\"You know just before the last election, the Cubans from Miami, where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote close to 90%...\" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico\\n\\nFacts First: Trump did not get anywhere near 90% of the Cuban-American vote, in Miami or elsewhere, according to multiple analyses : Trump did not get anywhere near 90% of the Cuban-American vote, in Miami or elsewhere, according to multiple analyses reported on by the Miami Herald when Trump claimed in 2017 that he had received \"84%\" of the Cuban-American vote. The Herald noted that estimates range from 50% to 58%.\\n\\nThe Herald reported: \"Mauricio Claver-Carone, former executive director of the US-Cuba Democracy PAC who was appointed by Trump to the Treasury Department, estimated that Trump won 58% of the Cuban-American vote based on his review of results from about 30 Miami-Dade precincts with large Cuban-American populations.\" As the Herald reported, University of Florida professor Daniel A. Smith found that Trump\\'s best performance with Cuban-American voters in any Miami-Dade precinct was 68%.\\n\\nMilitary aid to Ukraine\\n\\nQuestion: \"How do you explain the military aid, sir? How do you explain delaying military aid (inaudible)?\" Trump: \"Because I want Germany and I want France and I want the European Union to put up money. And I didn\\'t delay anything.

CNN , the Washington Post and the New York Times reported that Trump himself ordered the hold on the aid.\\n\\nTrump was correct that the aid was eventually paid, but he was incorrect when he denied the very existence of a delay; the delay has been publicly discussed by members of Congress and by people who were serving in the Ukrainian government this summer. The Post reported that although the Trump administration notified congressional officials in February and in May that portions of the aid was going to be released, but the release didn\\'t actually happen until September.\\n\\nThe estate tax\\n\\n\"And to keep New Mexico\\'s farms, ranches and small businesses in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax or death tax so that you can now give your farm or your ranch to your children.\" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico\\n\\nFacts First: Trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. His 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but : Trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. His 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but did not get rid of the tax entirely\\n\\nIt\\'s also misleading to suggest that the estate tax had been a particular burden on farms and small businesses; very few of them were paying the tax even before Trump\\'s changes came into effect. According to the Tax Policy Center, a mere 50 farms and closely held businesses were among the 5,190 estates to pay the estate tax in 2017, before Trump\\'s tax law. The Center wrote on its website: \"The Tax Policy Center estimates that small farms and businesses will pay $20 million in estate tax in 2017, one-tenth of 1 percentage of the total estate tax revenue.\"\\n\\nOil prices\\n\\n\"Our country is doing well. You look at so many different things. Look at all of the regulation cutting that allows us to do what we did. Look at what happened three days ago — where you have an attack like that and it takes out a big chunk of oil, and the prices go up $4, $5, and now it\\'s heading down rapidly. That tells you — that would have happened years ago, it would have gone up $50. It would\\'ve doubled. And this was a blip.\" -- September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison\\n\\nFacts First: Though oil prices did head back downward after an initial spike after the attack on Saudi oil facilities, that initial spike was larger than $4 or $5: : Though oil prices did head back downward after an initial spike after the attack on Saudi oil facilities, that initial spike was larger than $4 or $5: Brent crude futures , the international benchmark, and West Texas Intermediate futures both rose more than $8, about 15% each, between the close of trading on Friday, before the attack, and the close of trading on Monday; it was the largest single-day percentage gain for Brent since at least 1988, Reuters reported\\n\\nWe can\\'t fact check Trump\\'s hypothetical about what might have happened to oil prices if the attack had occurred some unspecified number of years ago.\\n\\nThe cost of the Mueller investigation\\n\\n\"House Judiciary has given up on the Mueller Report, sadly for them after two years and $40,000,000 spent...\" -- September 16 tweet\\n\\n\"...they spent $40 million -- there\\'s not a person in the room that I couldn\\'t find something on with that.\" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico\\n\\nFacts First: The Mueller investigation cost $32 million, not $40 million, according to : The Mueller investigation cost $32 million, not $40 million, according to figures released by the Justice Department -- and the government is expected recoup about $17 million as a result of the investigation, according to a CNN analysis of the sentences handed out to people charged by Mueller.\\n\\nThe vast majority of this $17 million is expected to come from former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was ordered to forfeit assets and pay millions to the Internal Revenue Service.\\n\\nHere\\'s a list of claims we\\'ve fact checked before in one of our weekly updates:\\n\\nImmigration\\n\\nMexican troops on the border\\n\\n\"And I want to thank the President of Mexico, who right now has 27,000 soldiers on our southern border. It\\'s been incredible what\\'s taken place in a short period of time.\" -- September 22 speech at Howdy, Modi event in Houston\\n\\nFacts First: The approximately 26,000 troops are split between the US border and Mexico\\'s southern border. Trump himself said in late July that 6,000 of the troops were near Guatemala; speaking to the press in September, acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan said , \"Since June, Mexico has deployed thousands of troops. They\\'ve created a new national guard within their country: 10,000 troops to the southern border; 15,000 troops to the norther border with the United States.\"\\n\\nMexico\\'s immigration assistance\\n\\n\"You know, Mexico has never done anything to impede people from pouring into our country, and now they\\'re doing just the opposite. They\\'ve really been incredible.\" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit\\n\\nFacts First: Mexico also took action to impede migrants from entering the United States during the Obama administration.\\n\\nAndrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, noted that the Mexican government beefed up its border enforcement measures as part of a cooperation program with the US that aimed to address the 2014 surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America. \"The numbers of unaccompanied minors dropped as a result of this cooperation (and the two countries dealt with a second, smaller spike in 2016 the same way),\" Selee said. He added: \"The Mexican government has actually deported more Central Americans to their home countries since 2015 than the US government has, sharply limiting the number of migrants from that region that have made it to the US border.\"\\n\\nBuilding the wall\\n\\n\"Well, this section is 14 (miles), but we\\'re building many that are 50 and 40 and 17 and different areas. We\\'re building on many different sites all up and down along the border.\" -- September 18 interview with Fox News\\' Ed Henry\\n\\n\"Well, you know we\\'re building the wall and it\\'s going up and it\\'s going up fast.\" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico\\n\\n\"Now, the wall still, obviously, has a ways to go, but we\\'re building it at a breakneck speed.\" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit\\n\\nFacts First: Trump was exaggerating the pace of border-barrier construction. No new miles of border wall had been built during Trump\\'s presidency as of August, Customs and Border Protection told CNN\\'s Geneva Sands. Sixty miles of existing barriers had been replaced over Trump\\'s tenure in office, but Trump was incorrect that there are \"many\" sections of 50, 40 and 17 miles under construction.\\n\\nDemocrats and the border\\n\\nTrump said the Democrats have an agenda of \"open borders.\" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico\\n\\nFacts First: Even Democratic presidential candidates who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests.\\n\\nHuman trafficking\\n\\n\"If you want to stop the drug smugglers and the human traffickers, how about the human traffic? And they traffic really for the most part in women, that\\'s what they traffic in, it\\'s women. They\\'re not trafficking in men, they capture women and they bring them across the open borders and they don\\'t go through ports of entry where you have guards standing there with guns and rifles and everything else. They go out into the desert areas and they hang a left or they hang a right and they come in.\" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico\\n\\nFacts First: Many human trafficking victims do indeed come through ports of entry, according to US experts on trafficking and according to international data.\\n\\nExperts say that victims are more likely to be deceived into crossing the border willingly than kidnapped and put in the back of a vehicle. \"I have worked on human trafficking on multiple continents in multiple countries for more than two decades, and in all the work that I\\'ve done with trafficking victims, I have met one who was actually kidnapped and thrown into a car,\" Martina Vandenberg of the Human Trafficking Legal Center told CNN in January, when Trump was telling frequent stories about women being bound and gagged in cars.\\n\\nMany victims, experts say, are tricked into coming to the US with promises of a good job. Others are coerced through threats to their families or themselves. While experts say there may be some cases like the ones Trump has described, they emphasize that such cases are in a small minority. In 2018, the UN International Organization for Migration found that \"in the last 10 years, almost 80% of journeys undertaken by victims trafficked internationally cross through official border points, such as airports and land border control points.\"\\n\\nDemocrats\\n\\nThe Green New Deal, cows and planes\\n\\n\"Now, under the Green New Deal that (energy revenue) all goes away, that all goes away. It all goes away. You can forget it. No more cows, no more airplanes, no more trips.\" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico\\n\\nFacts First: The Democrats\\' Green New Deal environmental resolution does not call for the elimination of cows or planes.\\n\\nTrump did not make up this claim out of thin air. A \"FAQ\" page that once appeared on the website of a leading Green New Deal proponent, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, calls for the government to \"build out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary.\" In explaining why Green New Deal proponents were aiming to get to \"net-zero\" carbon emissions in 10 years rather than the more ambitious goal of zero carbon emissions at all, the FAQ said, \"We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren\\'t sure that we\\'ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.\"\\n\\nThe FAQ was not an official party document and has not been broadly adopted by Green New Deal supporters. Its language about cows and planes does not appear in the text of the Green New Deal resolution many congressional Democrats have endorsed. The resolution calls for \"overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector\" and \"working collaboratively with farmers and ranchers in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector as much as is technologically feasible.\\n\\nPopularity and accomplishments\\n\\nSpecial election in North Carolina\\'s 9th District\\n\\nTrump said North Carolina congressional candidate Dan Bishop, who won a September special election, was down \"17 points three weeks ago,\" before Trump got involved. -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico\\n\\nFacts First: Bishop was not down 17 points in any : Bishop was not down 17 points in any public poll , though some did have him trailing by single-digit margins.\\n\\nWhen we tweeted about this, Matt Wolking, deputy director of communications for the Trump campaign, responded \"Try harder\" -- pointing to a tweet by Jim Blaine, a Republican strategist, that included an apparent poll excerpt that showed Bishop down 14.\\n\\nBut 14 is not 17. And neither Wolking nor Blaine responded to our questions about who conducted the poll, who it was conducted for, when it was conducted, what its methodology was, or what its sample size was; Blaine\\'s tweet did not include any of that information.\\n\\nSpecial election in North Carolina\\'s 3rd District\\n\\nTrump said Greg Murphy, who won the special election in North Carolina\\'s 3rd District, \"was up a couple of points\" before his victory. -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico\\n\\nFacts First: Murphy was leading by significantly more than \"a couple of points,\" according to public polling. One : Murphy was leading by significantly more than \"a couple of points,\" according to public polling. One late poll had him up by 11 points.\\n\\nThe poll was in line with pundits\\' expectations for the race, which was widely seen to be an easy Republican victory. Murphy was running in a district formerly held by the late Republican Rep. Walter Jones, who ran unopposed by the Democrats in the 2018 election; and Trump won the district by about 24 points in 2016.\\n\\nTrump could have fairly said Murphy outperformed the polls, since he won by 24 points, but \"a couple of points\" is incorrect.\\n\\nSuppression polls\\n\\n\"Now, if it\\'s close, like it\\'s in play, you know you wait two three four or five hours to see what it is, but they don\\'t even take a breath because they\\'re called suppression polls, and they\\'re no different than all of the dishonest reporting that you people say. They\\'re no different. They\\'re suppression polls.\" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico\\n\\nFacts First: There is simply no evidence that pollsters have manipulated their numbers to suppress the enthusiasm of Trump voters, as Trump has repeatedly alleged.\\n\\nVeterans Choice\\n\\nTrump boasted that he was the one who got the Veterans Choice health care Trump passed, saying, \"They\\'ve tried to get that for 45 years. They haven\\'t been able to get it. But I\\'m good at getting things.\" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico\\n\\nFacts First: The Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was : The Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was signed into law by Barack Obama in 2014. In 2018, Trump signed the VA Mission Act, which expanded and changed the program.\\n\\nForeign and military affairs\\n\\nVenezuela\\'s wealth\\n\\n\"Look at Venezuela: Venezuela, 15 years ago, was one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and today very sad, no food, no water, no nothing.\" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico\\n\\nFacts First: Venezuela was not one of the world\\'s wealthiest countries 15 years ago.\\n\\nThe International Monetary Fund ranked Venezuela 67th in the world in 2004 by GDP per capita, at $4,019 (US) -- better than more than half of the world\\'s countries, but nowhere near the top.\\n\\n\"Venezuela was one of the richest countries in the world 60 years ago. The richest in Latin America 40 years ago. But not 20 years ago,\" Ricardo Hausmann, a former Venezuelan planning minister and central bank board member, said in response to a previous version of this Trump claim. Hausmann, now a Harvard University professor of economic development, was chief economist of the Inter-American Development Bank from 1994 to 2000.\\n\\nThe war in Afghanistan\\n\\n\"We have hit — in Afghanistan, we have hit the Taliban harder than they\\'ve ever been hit in the entire 19 years of war.\" -- September 20 exchange with reporters at a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison\\n\\nFacts First: We\\'ll ignore Trump\\'s subjective claim about how \"hard\" the US is attacking the Taliban. \"Nineteen years of war,\" though, was a small exaggeration. The US invaded Afghanistan in October 2001, nearly 18 years ago. This was not a one-time slip though; Trump habitually says \"19 years.\"\\n\\nThe Iran nuclear deal\\n\\n\"The problem was, the deal that was signed by the previous administration was a disaster — which, by the way, would be expiring in a very short period of time also. So you really don\\'t have a deal. You know, that deal was a very short-term deal. So they made a deal, but it was for a very short period of time. So that deal would be expiring very soon.\" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain\\n\\nFacts First: Some central provisions of the nuclear agreement with Iran were written to expire in the next 10 to 15 years. But the deal as a whole -- including a blanket prohibition on Iran developing nuclear weapons -- was written to continue in perpetuity. You can read a fuller fact check : Some central provisions of the nuclear agreement with Iran were written to expire in the next 10 to 15 years.

Many come from Germany, many come from France, many come from Holland -- really most of them come from various European countries. And we want them to take them back.\" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One\\n\\n\"They mostly come out of Europe.\" -- September 20 exchange with reporters at a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison\\n\\nFacts First: According to Trump\\'s own government estimates, a minority of ISIS fighters being held in Syria came from Europe.\\n\\nJames Jeffrey, Trump\\'s special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition, said August 1 that about 8,000 of 10,000 terrorist fighters who were then prisoners in northeastern Syria were Iraqi or Syrian nationals; there were \"about 2,000 ISIS foreign fighters\" from all other countries.\\n\\nTrump himself tweeted in February to ask that European countries take back \"over 800\" ISIS fighters captured in Syria.\\n\\nRemains from North Korea\\n\\n\"We\\'ve gotten our hostages back. We\\'ve gotten our great soldiers back who were killed — many of them. And many more are coming back. We have many more coming back. And the families of those — we call them \\'our heroes.\\' And they were our heroes. And they\\'re coming back.\" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit\\n\\nFacts First: While North Korea returned some remains last year, it is no longer doing so. The US military announced in May that the remains program had been suspended for the rest of the 2019 fiscal year because North Korea had stopped communicating with the US agency responsible for the effort.\\n\\nTrump could accurately tout the return of remains in the past tense: North Korea returned 55 cases of possible remains in the summer of 2018. But the remains are no longer being returned. You can read a longer fact check of this claim here\\n\\nTrade\\n\\nUnions and the USMCA\\n\\nTrump said of his USMCA trade agreement, \"Unions love it.\" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico\\n\\nFacts First: The agreement is generally opposed in its current form by major US unions, who have demanded changes to the text; the president of the AFL-CIO federation : The agreement is generally opposed in its current form by major US unions, who have demanded changes to the text; the president of the AFL-CIO federation says it will be a \"disaster for workers\" if it is not amended. As The New York Times has reported, the United Automobile Workers and United Steelworkers, among other unions, have also demanded changes.\\n\\nTrade deficit with China\\n\\nTrump said the trade deficit with China was $500 billion, alleging that previous presidents allowed China to \"to take out $500 billion a year\" or even \"more than that\" including theft of intellectual property. -- September 20 exchange with reporters at meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison\\n\\nFacts First: Trump refers to trade deficits as losses and surpluses as gains or takings, though this characterization is rejected by many economists. The US trade deficit with China has never been $500 billion; it was : Trump refers to trade deficits as losses and surpluses as gains or takings, though this characterization is rejected by many economists. The US trade deficit with China has never been $500 billion; it was $381 billion last year when counting goods and services, $420 billion when counting goods alone.\\n\\nAid to farmers\\n\\nTalking about his tariffs on China, Trump said, \"And I\\'m taking care of our farmers out of that. We\\'re helping our farmers. Our farmers were targeted, and they were targeted for $16 billion. And I made that up to them. We paid them the $16 billion and had tens of billions of dollars left over.\" -- September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison\\n\\nFacts First: It\\'s incorrect that there are tens of billions of dollars left over in tariff receipts after accounting for the $28 billion Trump has pledged to farmers affected by his trade war with China. (The $16 billion Trump mentioned here was a : It\\'s incorrect that there are tens of billions of dollars left over in tariff receipts after accounting for the $28 billion Trump has pledged to farmers affected by his trade war with China. (The $16 billion Trump mentioned here was a second announcement that followed an earlier $12 billion announcement. The China-specific tariffs have generated a total of about $30 billion, according to the US government\\'s tracking data as of September 24.\\n\\nWho is paying for Trump\\'s tariffs on China\\n\\nTrump said twice that China is \"eating the tariffs\" he has imposed on imports of Chinese products, and he said on a third occasion that the government was taking in the tariff revenue \"from China.\"\\n\\nFacts First: A bevy of : A bevy of economic studies has found that Americans are bearing the overwhelming majority of the tariff costs, and Americans make the actual tariff payments.\\n\\nChina\\'s economic performance\\n\\nTrump said four times that China is having its worst economic year in \"57 years.\"\\n\\nFacts First: China\\'s second-quarter growth rate was the : China\\'s second-quarter growth rate was the worst in 27 years . Trump has repeatedly made clear that he knows that this is the reported figure, but he has added additional years for no apparent reason.\\n\\nHistory of the tariffs\\n\\nOn three occasions on which eh talked about tariff revenue, Trump said the US has never previously received \"10 cents,\" \"100 cents\" or \"billions\" from China.\\n\\nFacts First: The US government has been charging tariffs on imported Chinese goods for more than two centuries, and it took in billions from such tariffs long before Trump imposed his own tariffs. (As always, we\\'ll note it is US importers and consumers, not China, who have paid these tariffs.)\\n\\nThe Treasury received $14 billion from tariffs on China in 2014 , to look at one pre-Trump year.\\n\\nEconomy and energy\\n\\nAutomotive investments\\n\\n\"My relationship has been very powerful with the autoworkers — not necessarily the top person or two, but the people that work doing automobiles. Nobody has ever brought more companies into the United States. You know, I have Japan and Germany, and many countries have been bringing car companies in and opening plants and expanding plants. \" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain\\n\\nFacts First: Contrary to Trump\\'s claims, there has been no boom in investment from Japanese, German, or other foreign automakers during his tenure. From Trump\\'s inauguration through July, the Center for Automotive Research, a nonprofit that studies the industry, found 66 automaker announcements of new US manufacturing facilities, or expansions or updates to existing facilities. The center found 170 such announcements in Obama\\'s (four-year) first term, 154 in Obama\\'s second term, according to the center\\'s Bernard Swiecki.\\n\\nJust two Japanese car companies, Toyota and Mazda, have announced plans to build a US plant (together) during Trump\\'s presidency; their joint venture is under construction in Alabama. There is no evidence Trump was personally responsible for this investment decision.\\n\\nTrump has said since 2018 that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has told him that more Japanese carmakers will soon announce major US investments.

Obama presided over a boom in liquefied natural gas exports and signed a bill lifting a 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports.\\n\\n\"The truth is that both of the presidents of this decade (President Obama and President Trump) have presided over an incredibly brisk expansion of our capacity to produce oil and refined products.

       "  'text': 'The White House on Wednesday released a transcript of President Trump’s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky showing he sought a review of Biden family dealings in the country — but the document does not show Trump explicitly leveraging military aid as part of a quid pro quo, as Democrats have suggested in pressing forward with impeachment.\\n\\nThe document, declassified by Trump a day earlier, indicates that the call – which Trump made from the White House residence -- took place July 25 from 9:03 a.m. to 9:33 a.m. A notation on the memo says it does not represent a \"verbatim transcript\" but is based on \"notes and recollections\" of those listening and memorializing the call. It is still presented in transcript form.\\n\\nThe memo begins with the president congratulating Zelensky on his election victory, before Trump eventually broaches the subject former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\\n\\nREAD THE UKRAINE CALL MEMO\\n\\n“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said in the phone call. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”\\n\\nThis refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.\\n\\nTrump, in the run-up to the transcript\\'s release, was accused by Democrats of essentially pressuring a foreign power to investigate a political opponent, as Biden is now a top contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\\n\\nOn Monday, it was reported that Trump had even ordered his staff to freeze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine a few days before the phone call with Zelensky, a detail that fueled impeachment calls and led House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday. But the call transcript does not show Trump explicitly mentioning the aid as a bargaining chip or otherwise — though Zelensky did appear to reference military aid early in the call, when he thanked Trump for \"great support in the area of defense.\"\\n\\nTrump also noted early on that the U.S. has been \"very very good to Ukraine\" as he suggested the relationship is not always \"reciprocal.\"\\n\\nThe transcript shows Zelensky eventually suggesting to Trump the Biden matter would be looked into by a new prosecutor. “He or she will look into the situation specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue, the issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and we will work on the investigation of the case.”\\n\\nTrump told Zelensky he wanted his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General William Barr to get involved.\\n\\n“I will have Mr. Giuliani give you call and I’m also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it. I’m sure you will figure it out,” he said.\\n\\nA Department of Justice spokeswoman, Kerri Kupec, said in a statement that the attorney general was first notified of the president’s conversation with Zelensky several weeks after the call took place, “when the Department of Justice learned of a potential referral.”\\n\\n“The president has not spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son,” Kupec said. “The president has not asked the Attorney General to contact Ukraine — on this or any other matter. The attorney general has not communicated with Ukraine — on this or any other subject. Nor has the Attorney General discussed this matter, or anything related to Ukraine, with Rudy Giuliani.”\\n\\nBefore the transcript was released, Democrats accused Trump of improperly using his office to pressure another country to investigate one of his chief Democratic rivals. Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, said during an appearance on Fox News: \"There\\'s no quid pro quo and there\\'s no pressure.\"\\n\\nTrump has denied wrongdoing and has repeatedly referred to the impeachment push as a partisan “witch hunt.”\\n\\n“Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President? They should, a perfect call - got them by surprise!” the president tweeted Wednesday.\\n\\nThe Trump-Zelensky conversation led to a whistleblower complaint against the president, provoking the avalanche of impeachment calls from Democrats.\\n\\nBut the Justice Department – in a new letter from the Office of Legal Counsel obtained by Fox News – is pushing back on the claim that the whistleblower brought out something of “urgent concern” that would have to be turned over to Congress.\\n\\n“For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the complaint submitted to the [intelligence community inspector general] does not involve an \\'urgent concern\\'…” It adds: “As a result, the statute does not require that the [Director of National Intelligence] transmit the complaint to the intelligence committees.”\\n\\nThe DOJ opinion also said the intelligence community inspector general found “some indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the complainant in favor of a rival political candidate,” but still said the allegations “appeared credible.” Fox News previously reported that, according to a source, the individual also did not have “firsthand knowledge” of the phone call.\\n\\nSources, meanwhile, said the original allegations spoke to a possible campaign finance violation, but the DOJ concluded that Trump’s request for an investigation did not qualify as a “thing of value” for his campaign – and therefore did not constitute a criminal violation.\\n\\nOn Tuesday night, Pelosi – who had resisted calls from the liberal base to pursue articles of impeachment – announced a formal impeachment inquiry against the president. Even without a \"quid pro quo\" illustrated in the transcript, Democrats are likely to move full speed ahead on impeachment. Wednesday’s transcript release is the first time lawmakers have seen exactly what was said in the conversation.\\n\\nDemocrats, though, have said they won’t be satisfied with just seeing the transcript and have said they want access to the full whistleblower report. That complaint may soon be turned over, however, as the administration weighs how to handle the document.\\n\\nThe transcript also shows Trump asking for a “favor” in the form of Ukraine providing information about the hacking of the DNC server in 2016. He referenced CrowdStrike, a cyber firm used by the DNC to investigate the attacks.\\n\\n“I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike… I guess you have one of your wealthy people… The server, they say Ukraine has it,” Trump said.\\n\\nDuring the call, Trump also blasted what he referred to as Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s “very poor performance” before Congress in July about the Trump-Russia investigation. Trump added, “a lot of it started with Ukraine” and asked for help in gathering information about the probe\\'s origins. “Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible,” Trump said.\\n\\nLater on Wednesday, Trump is slated to meet with Zelensky, in what will be a high-stakes moment amid the impeachment push, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. The meeting was previously scheduled, unrelated to the whistleblower allegation, though the two leaders are expected to receive questions from reporters on the matter.\\n\\nTrump then is expected to hold a press conference in New York in the late afternoon, where the impeachment drive is sure to be front and center.\\n\\nA senior Trump administration official told Fox News that the White House has been working as quickly as it can to release to Congress the whistleblower complaint involving Trump’s conversations with the Ukrainian president, as long as it’s legally possible.\\n\\nThe White House has maintained that they have nothing to hide and that there has been no wrongdoing. Their general position has been that it will make everything possible available to Congress or the public regarding Trump’s call and the complaint to the intelligence community’s inspector general.\\n\\n“The president must be held accountable,” Pelosi said Tuesday, citing his alleged “betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections.”\\n\\nFox News’ Ed Henry, Jake Gibson, Catherine Herridge, Kevin Corke and Brooke Singman contributed to this report.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Top congressional Democrats made clear Wednesday they will stay the course on impeachment after the release of a rough transcript of President Trump’s controversial July call with Ukraine’s president, though the document did not demonstrate an explicit quid pro quo as some reports originally had suggested.\\n\\n“This is a classic Mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said.\\n\\nThe memo, which does not reflect a “verbatim transcript” but is based on “notes and recollections” of those memorializing the call, shows Trump congratulating newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on his victory before Trump eventually gets to the subject of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, seeking an investigation of some kind.\\n\\nUKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, ASKED ABOUT DNC SERVER, BUT MADE NO MENTION OF US AID\\n\\nWhile the transcript shows Trump pressing Ukraine to \"look into\" the Bidens, it does not show the U.S. president explicitly linking that request to U.S. aid -- which had been frozen days earlier, a detail that fueled impeachment calls earlier this week and helped prompt Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday.\\n\\nBut Schiff downplayed the absence of any explicit quid pro quo, saying Wednesday it is clear what the president was after.\\n\\nSchiff noted that during the call, Trump lamented that the relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine was not always \"reciprocal,\" a comment he made after noting how \"very very good\" the U.S. had been to Ukraine. Zelensky went on to discuss military assistance -- after which, Trump started making certain requests.\\n\\nTrump first asked Zelensky to do a \"favor\" and “find out what happened” with the hacking of the DNC server in 2016. He referenced CrowdStrike, a cyber firm used by the DNC to investigate the attacks.\\n\\nThen, Trump went on to seek assistance in investigating the Bidens.\\n\\n“The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”\\n\\nThis refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Schiff said all these details “are far more damning than I and others had imagined.”\\n\\n“This is the Ukrainian president who is desperate for military support…[Trump] tells him he has a favor to ask,” he said.\\n\\nSchiff added: “[Trump] communicates that the U.S. has done a lot for Ukraine, but there is not much reciprocity. This is how a mafia boss talks. \\'What have you done for us? I have a favor I want to ask you.\\'”\\n\\n“Of course, the favor is to investigate his political rival. To investigate the Bidens,” Schiff said, adding that another “layer” of misconduct was Trump’s attempt to use Attorney General Bill Barr and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani as “emissaries” who would be “part and parcel in this.”\\n\\nUKRAINE CALL WHISTLEBLOWER SHOWED \\'POLITICAL BIAS,\\' FAVORED TRUMP\\'S \\'RIVAL\\' CANDIDATE: MEMO\\n\\n“The fact that the president would invoke the attorney general sends a further message to Ukraine—this is not just me asking, this is not just Giuliani asking, but this is the United States government,” Schiff said.\\n\\nThe transcript shows Trump saying he wanted the Ukrainian president to speak with both Barr and Giuliani.\\n\\n“There is no quid pro quo necessary to betray your country or your oath of office,” Schiff continued. “Ukraine understood what this president wanted. He had his emissaries making it clear, and Ukraine knew what it needed to do if it wanted to get military assistance.”\\n\\nSchiff and other top committee chairs later released a statement saying: \"Let’s be clear: no quid pro quo is required to betray our country. Trump asked a foreign government to interfere in our elections—that is betrayal enough.\" The chairmen added that they will subpoena the White House and State Department for a related whistleblower complaint and other information, should they miss a Thursday deadline to turn it over.\\n\\nThis stance suggests Democrats will charge ahead on their impeachment inquiry, \"quid pro quo\" or not.\\n\\nSchiff is likely to be a key figure in the process, as Pelosi\\'s Tuesday decision takes all Trump-focused investigations from six prominent House committees and puts them all “under one umbrella,” according to a Democratic source.\\n\\nPelosi, on Wednesday, also stood by the need for impeachment.\\n\\n“The transcript and the Justice Department’s acting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the President’s lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry,” she said in a statement. “Clearly, the Congress must act.”\\n\\nBiden himself also said in a statement that the document “makes clear that days after the President ordered the delay of Congressionally-appropriated military assistance to Ukraine, he implored the President of Ukraine to work with his personal attorney to manufacture a smear against a domestic political opponent.”\\n\\nBut the White House and Trump allies adamantly denied wrongdoing and described the transcript as exculpatory.\\n\\nWhite House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News on Wednesday that “there’s no quid pro quo and there’s no pressure.”\\n\\nHouse Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Ga., also said there was no quid pro quo, and said the Democrats “leapt to conclusions before looking at the facts.”\\n\\n“The real danger here is that Democrats keep using baseless accusations in hopes of crippling a successful presidency,” Collins said in a statement Wednesday.\\n\\nWhile the transcript does show Trump asking Zelensky to probe Biden, it does not show Trump explicitly linking U.S. aid to Ukraine. Administration officials told Fox News on Tuesday that, at the time, U.S. aid to Ukraine was frozen, but claimed that it was over corruption concerns and other countries not paying their fair share.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Democrats are moving on other fronts as well.\\n\\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., has called for Barr to step aside from any review of the matter.\\n\\n“The President dragged the Attorney General into this mess,” Nadler tweeted. “At a minimum, AG Barr must recuse himself until we get to the bottom of this matter.”\\n\\nThe Justice Department, though, has denied involvement in any potential investigations into Biden or anything else.\\n\\n“The president has not spoken with the attorney general about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son,” Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said. “The president has not asked the attorney general to contact Ukraine—on this or any other matter. The attorney general has not communicated with Ukraine—on this or any other subject. Nor has the attorney general discussed this matter, or anything related to Ukraine, with Rudy Giuliani.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., questioned why Giuliani was involved in the first place.\\n\\n“What role does Rudolph Giuliani have in this government?” he asked during a House Democratic press conference Wednesday. “Is he in the Department of Justice? Is he the secretary of state? Is he an ambassador to Ukraine or to the European Union?”\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n“Rudolph Giuliani is the president’s political hit man,” he continued. “And in an official conversation with the president of Ukraine, he directed the Ukrainian president to have a follow up conversation with Giuliani as part of the effort to dig up dirt on Joe Biden.”\\n\\nThe Washington Post on Wednesday reported that Giuliani has been involved in pursuing a \"shadow agenda\" with Ukraine—an allegation the former New York City mayor has denied, calling it “complete nonsense.”\\n\\nHe tweeted Wednesday: \"The transcript really shows how dishonest news media is.

Warren’s two-point edge is well within the survey’s margin of error.\\n\\nWarren has surged 8 percentage points since Quinnipiac’s previous national poll, which was conducted late last month, with Biden -- long considered the frontrunner in the race -- dropping seven points.\\n\\nSanders, the independent populist longtime lawmaker who’s making his second straight White House bid, stands at 16 percent in the new survey, basically unchanged from last month.\\n\\n\"After trailing Biden by double digits since March in the race for the Democratic nomination, Warren catches Biden,\" Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said. \"We now have a race with two candidates at the top of the field, and they’re leaving the rest of the pack behind.\"\\n\\nGoing beyond the poll’s topline numbers, Malloy noted that if you “dig a little deeper…the reasons behind Warren\\'s rise become more clear.

On top of that, half of Democrats want a presidential candidate that supports big changes - even if it means things are harder along the way.\"\\n\\nSouth Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg stands at 7 percent in the new Quinnipiac poll, with Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 3 percent. Everyone else in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential contenders registered at 2 percent or less.\\n\\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\\n\\nMany political analysts downplay the results of national polls, pointing to the fact the race for the presidential nomination is a battle for the states and their delegates to the parties\\' nominating conventions. But the Quinnipiac results follow similar findings in polls released the past couple of days in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, the first three states to vote in the presidential primary and caucus nominating calendar.\\n\\nWarren stands at 27 percent among likely Democratic presidential primary voters in New Hampshire in a Monmouth University survey released Tuesday, with Biden at 25 percent. Warren’s 2-point edge is well within that survey’s sampling error. Sanders is in third in the poll, at 12 percent.\\n\\nA couple of hours after the release of the Monmouth poll in New Hampshire, a new survey in Nevada, which holds its caucus following the New Hampshire primary, also indicates a close contest between Biden and Warren.\\n\\nA USA Today/Suffolk University survey put Biden at 23 percent, Warren at 19 percent and Sanders at 14 percent.\\n\\nAnd in Iowa, a Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll released this past weekend indicated Warren at 22 percent, Biden at 20 percent and Sanders a distant third at 11 percent. The Des Moines Register surveys have long been considered the gold standard in Iowa polling.\\n\\nThe release of the surveys come as Warren’s campaign on Tuesday announced they’re spending a whopping $10-million to run digital and TV ads over the next few months in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, which votes fourth in the nominating calendar and holds the first southern primary.\\n\\nWARREN DISHING OUT $10 MILLION TO RUN DIGITAL AND TV ADS IN ALL FOUR EARLY VOTING STATES\\n\\nThe release of these new live telephone operator polls comes with just over four months to go until the first votes in Iowa. But that can be an eternity in campaign politics.\\n\\nWarren continues to downplay her surge in the surveys, telling reporters a few days ago that, “I don’t do polls. We are still months away from the Iowa caucuses and the first primary elections.”\\n\\nThe pollsters agree. Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray noted that “it is important to keep in mind that the race is still very much in flux.”\\n\\nThe Quinnipiac University poll was conducted September 19-23, with 1,337 registered voters nationwide – including 561 self-described Democratic voters independents who lean towards the Democrats – questioned by telephone. The sampling error for the survey Democratic nomination questions is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.',\n",

       "  'text': \"With Nancy Pelosi finally bowing to Democratic pressure and launching a formal impeachment inquiry, many in the media may be getting their wish.\\n\\nAfter all, many pundits, especially on the left, longed for the same outcome during the Russia investigation, only to be bitterly disappointed.\\n\\nBut the Ukraine uproar has a far simpler story line than the complicated Russia probe. And it proved a tipping point for the House speaker, who has long believed that impeachment could boomerang on the Democrats without ultimately ousting Trump, who she sees as highly vulnerable in 2020. But with 175 of her members, including some moderates, hopping on the impeachment bandwagon, Pelosi could no longer stem the tide.\\n\\nHOW TRUMP AND ALLIES ARE SHIFTING THE UKRAINE SPOTLIGHT TO BIDEN\\n\\nIn a flag-bedecked speech, Pelosi said Trump’s actions on Ukraine “have seriously violated the Constitution,” that he “must be held accountable,” and announcing an “official” investigation by a half-dozen committees.\\n\\nAs strange as it sounds, Pelosi’s reluctant move could in some ways help Trump, because it shifts the terms of debate.\\n\\nTrump’s preferred mode of defense is to go on offense—whether it’s against Crooked Hillary, Mueller’s angry Democrats or Sleepy Joe’s alleged transgressions. It’s all about demonizing the other side, just as the left does to Trump.\\n\\nEspecially after his planned release today of a transcript of his July call with Ukraine’s leader, the president and his allies can argue that even if he went too far in bringing up Joe Biden with a foreign leader, it does not warrant the drastic remedy of impeachment.\\n\\nHe’s already called it “witch hunt garbage,” and will undoubtedly cast it as one perpetrated by his enemies in the opposition party, the press and the Deep State. He can energize his supporters, who will see their hero in danger of being forced from office. And the resulting fireworks will not only obliterate any semblance of a Democratic agenda, it will overshadow what Biden, Bernie, Elizabeth and the rest are doing on the trail.\\n\\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\\n\\nTrump asked, not unreasonably, how Pelosi could take this step without even having seen the details of the phone call.\\n\\nOutside the hothouse of the media and political world, I don’t sense that Ukraine has quite reached the level of a political earthquake. And that, for the moment, has the president’s critics baffled.\\n\\nI believe the media coverage is a key factor, as I’ll explain in a moment.\\n\\nBut first, there’s no doubt that the Washington Post moved the ball with a report that Trump told his acting chief of staff “to hold back almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine at least a week before a phone call in which Trump is said to have pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the son of former vice president Joe Biden, according to three senior administration officials.”\\n\\nThe piece says that OMB officials relayed Trump’s order to State and the Pentagon, and were ordered to give members of Congress no explanation beyond that the delay was part of an “interagency process.”\\n\\nThe story also quoted Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy as saying that Ukrainian President Zelensky told him during a visit this month that the aid was cut off as a “consequence” of his unwillingness to launch a probe of the Bidens. (The money has since been released.)\\n\\nThe president did not deny the story but shifted his explanation, saying he held up the money because he wanted Europe to pay more for Ukraine’s defense. He also scoffed at the notion of impeachment before his speech at the U.N., telling reporters: “What Joe Biden did for his son, that’s something they should be looking at.”\\n\\nThe New York Times’ Peter Baker reported yesterday morning that Trump now seems to be saying, as the headline puts it, “So What If I Did?”\\n\\nThe piece calls this “an astonishing breach of the norms governing the American presidency…If anything, the president has grown even more defiant since Mr. Mueller found insufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, almost as if having avoided charges, he is daring the establishment to come after him again. The man who once said he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan without consequence seems to be testing whether he can do the political equivalent.”\\n\\nWith more House Democrats coming out for impeachment—more than two-thirds of Nancy Pelosi’s caucus is now in that camp—the question of whether Ukraine is a dramatic tipping point looms large.\\n\\nMy sense is that there’s a fatigue factor for Trump scandals. And besides the president and Rudy Giuliani trying to shift the spotlight to the Bidens, as I wrote yesterday, the media coverage of the last few years is coloring the current climate.\\n\\nTake the Bob Mueller probe. While I’ve always argued the Russia investigation was a legitimately big story that led to several high-level indictments, can anyone really dispute that the coverage was so histrionic as to be misleading? The constant drumbeat was so relentless and so negative that it seemed only a matter of time before Trump was run out of town. Every minor development was cranked up to 11.\\n\\nAnd while the final report contained disturbing material, it also found no evidence that Trump actively cooperated with Russian operatives or hackers, and Mueller’s halting testimony was the final nail in the coffin.\\n\\nWhen the media fixated for more than a week on Sharpie-gate—and yes, Trump fueled the coverage with daily blasts about his handling of the hurricane—it was another case of runaway hype.\\n\\nThe same was true in episode after episode: Porn stars! Michael Cohen! S-hole countries! Omarosa! Tax returns! Greenland! Go back where they came from! Rat-infested Baltimore!\\n\\nMost of these controversies were very real, sometimes troubling, and yet trumpeted with a this-time-he’s-gone-too-far tone until each story faded. Trump’s constant pushback against the “fake news media,” and his attacks on Democrats and “witch hunt” investigators, added to the feeling that these were nothing more than partisan brawls.\\n\\nIn other words, journalists are suffering from boy-who-cried-wolf syndrome. Now that they have extremely serious allegations to pursue, the ensuing uproar sounds too much like so many other scandals and mini-scandals that, fairly or unfairly, didn’t move the needle.\\n\\nThere’s also an emerging theory, argued for some time by the Federalist’s Ben Domenech, that Trump wants to be impeached.\\n\\nRoss Douthat, the conservative, anti-Trump New York Times columnist, expanded on this view yesterday:\\n\\n“If the Democrats impeach him they will be doing something unpopular instead of something popular… the likely Democratic nominees are all more popular than Trump, and so anything that puts the Democrats on the wrong side of public opinion may look better, through Trump’s eyes, than the status quo…\\n\\n“Trump is happy to pit his overt abuses of power against the soft corruption of his foes. This is an aspect of Trumpism that the president’s critics find particularly infuriating — the way he attacks his rivals for being corrupt swamp creatures while being so much more nakedly compromised himself.”\\n\\nWhether or not you agree that he did something wrong, he excels at these dual-corruption debates, that it’s the other side that should face prison terms.\\n\\nNo president, not even Donald Trump, wants to be impeached. But if past journalistic excesses help convince the public that the Ukraine story is just more exaggeration, and if the press is viewed as a pro-impeachment movement, Trump will paint the media as helping the Democrats try to end his term.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during a meeting in New York with President Trump, told reporters Wednesday that he was not pressured to investigate the Biden family during their now-controversial phone call over the summer.\\n\\n“Nobody pushed me,” Zelensky said.\\n\\nThe comments come after the White House released a transcript reflecting that call. It showed Trump sought a probe into Biden family dealings in the country, though it did not show Trump explicitly linking the request to U.S. aid, as some have suggested.\\n\\nREAD THE FULL TRANSCRIPT HERE\\n\\n“We had a great phone call,” Zelensky added. “It was normal.”\\n\\nTrump interjected afterward: “In other words, there was no pressure and you know there was no pressure.”\\n\\nTrump’s meeting with Zelensky comes just hours after the White House released the transcript of their summertime call and less than a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she was opening an impeachment inquiry into Trump over the issue.\\n\\n“She’s lost her way, she’s been taken over by the radical left,” Trump said of Pelosi.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nThe speaker effectively endorsed the process, which to some degree had already been underway, after facing fresh pressure from inside the caucus to act.\\n\\nPelosi specifically charged that the administration had violated the law by not turning over a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump\\'s July call with Zelensky. Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence was blocking the release of that complaint, she said: \"This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal.\"\\n\\nBut Democrats also slammed the president for seeking the Biden-related probe in Ukraine in the first place.\\n\\n“This is a classic Mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Wednesday.\\n\\nTrump had urged Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had been separately and widely accused of corruption.\\n\\nWhile the transcript shows Trump pressing Ukraine to \"look into\" the Bidens, it does not show the U.S. president explicitly linking that request to U.S. aid -- millions of dollars of which had been frozen days earlier.\\n\\nTrump first asked Zelensky to do a \"favor\" and “find out what happened” with the hacking of the DNC server in 2016. He referenced CrowdStrike, a cyberfirm used by the DNC to investigate the attacks.\\n\\nUKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, ASKED ABOUT DNC SERVER, BUT MADE NO MENTION OF US AID\\n\\nThen, Trump went on to seek assistance in investigating the Bidens.\\n\\n“The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,” Trump said. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.”\\n\\nThe White House and Trump allies have adamantly denied wrongdoing and described the transcript as exculpatory. White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News on Wednesday that “there’s no quid pro quo and there’s no pressure.”\\n\\nBut Schiff downplayed the absence of any explicit quid pro quo.\\n\\nSchiff noted that during the call, Trump lamented that the relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine was not always \"reciprocal,\" a comment he made after noting how \"very very good\" the U.S. had been to Ukraine. Zelensky went on to discuss military assistance -- after which, Trump started making his requests regarding Biden.\\n\\n“There is no quid pro quo necessary to betray your country or your oath of office,” Schiff said.\\n\\nFox News\\' Judson Berger and Gregg Re contributed to this report.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The Senate on Wednesday voted for a second time to block President Trump’s border emergency declaration, with Republicans once again joining their Democratic colleagues in rebuking the president’s order.\\n\\nCiting their concerns over the expansion of presidential powers, 11 Republicans joined Democrats in voting for the resolution to put a stop to the emergency declaration from Trump. The resolution passed in a simple 54-41 vote, but it is not a veto-proof majority.\\n\\nThe resolution, which blocks the diversion of funds for the border wall, is likely to face another veto from Trump, who in March squashed a previous bipartisan vote to block his border emergency funding.\\n\\nPENTAGON CANCELS 3 BORDER BARRIER PROJECTS OVER COSTS\\n\\nThis vote is a clear rebuke to Trump by Republicans who believe he is abusing his authority and bypassing Congress when it comes to the appropriation of federal dollars.\\n\\nThe Republican senators who voted for the Democratic resolution were: Lamar Alexander of Tennessee; Roy Blunt of Missouri; Susan Collins of Maine; Mike Lee of Utah; Jerry Moran of Kansas; Lisa Murkowski of Alaska; Rand Paul of Kentucky; Rob Portman of Ohio; Mitt Romney of Utah; Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Roger Wicker of Mississippi.\\n\\nFox News is told that the House will likely make time on the floor later this week to vote to align with the Senate bill.\\n\\nWhen the Senate voted in March to block the emergency declaration, the Pentagon had not made public the list of the $3.6 billion in military construction projects that were being cancelled in order to pay for Trump’s much-touted wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. But earlier this month that was released and senators now know what specific projects in their states are being scrapped to pay for the wall.\\n\\nThis put pressure on a number of Republicans due for reelection in 2020 and was used before the vote by Democrats to paint the GOP supporting Trump’s declaration as being in favor of taking funding away from the military. The projects included a $63 million middle school in GOP Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\\'s state of Kentucky though most of them are located outside the continental U.S.\\n\\n“If Republicans choose to stand with President Trump, they’ll be saying they fully support allowing the president to take money from our military to fund a border wall,” Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said on Tuesday, according to The Washington Post.\\n\\nSchumer\\'s move to force a repeat vote put some Republicans in a difficult spot. For instance, endangered Republicans Cory Gardner of Colorado and Martha McSally of Arizona supported Trump in the earlier vote in March but stand to each lose funding for a home state project.\\n\\nTrump says a wall would stop immigrants from entering the United States illegally. He promised repeatedly during his 2016 presidential campaign that Mexico would pay for the wall, but Mexico refused.\\n\\nTrump originally issued the emergency declaration in February, after Congress granted only a fraction of the $5.7 billion he requested for a wall on the southern border. Declaring a national emergency allows Trump to steer an extra $3.6 billion to the wall.\\n\\nThe resolution shooting down Trump’s declaration is one of two high-profile votes taking place this week aimed at blocking the president from using special emergency powers to transfer money from military base construction projects, like new schools, to pay for new fences along the U.S.-Mexico border.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nThere is a potential vote on Thursday in the powerful Appropriations panel, where several members agree with Democrats that Trump is overstepping by reordering spending decisions by Congress to fund wall projects that have otherwise been rejected.\\n\\nA top Appropriations Democrat, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, said he will move to amend a $694 billion Pentagon funding bill to block Trump from diverting money intended for military projects to the wall.\\n\\n\"The cancellation of these projects is based on a national emergency declared by the president that was rejected on its face by both house of Congress on bipartisan votes,\" Durbin said. \"Congress cannot and should not be silent when the power of the purse is undermined in this way. Why are we here?\"\\n\\nDurbin would prevail in the vote if panel Republicans like Roy Blunt of Missouri and Susan Collins of Maine vote like they did in March — a development that would embarrass top Republicans like McConnell and Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby.\\n\\nFox News Chad Pergram, Adam Shaw and The Associated Press contributed to this report.',\n",

       "  'text': 'As Sen. Bernie Sanders sinks to a distant third in a number of new national and early voting state polls, top members of his presidential campaign are taking aim at Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts -- the other progressive superstar in the Democratic nomination race who’s soared ahead of Sanders in the surveys.\\n\\nThe swipes signal what could be a newly aggressive phase for the Vermont senator\\'s campaign, with a hitherto \"truce\" between him and Warren beginning to crack as his polling numbers suffer. One progressive strategist with ties to the independent senator’s campaign said that when it comes to negating Warren’s surge in the polls, the Sanders team has been “flailing around.”\\n\\nWARREN SURGES IN LATEST POLLS, TIES BIDEN FOR TOP SPOT; SANDERS SLIPS TO DISTANT THIRD\\n\\nSanders and Warren met last December before they launched their presidential bids and agreed to not criticize each other while on the campaign trail. That non-aggression-style pact has largely held – with both teaming up at recent presidential debates to defend their \"Medicare-for-all\" proposals.\\n\\nAnd both had refrained from attacking each other.\\n\\n“Bernie and I have been friends for many, many years. Long before I ever got into politics. And I don’t see any reason that that should change,” Warren told reporters recently after being asked if she was going to start painting contrasts with Sanders.\\n\\nSanders – who’s making his second straight White House run – has repeatedly said when asked about Warren that “Elizabeth is a friend of mine” and noting that the two “have been friends for over 20 years.”\\n\\nBut that’s apparently not stopping some leading members of Sanders\\' team from taking aim at Warren.\\n\\nThe Sanders campaign’s national press secretary Briahna Joy Gray recently criticized Warren on Twitter for failing to support Sanders’ national rent control proposal. Warren has said she doesn’t think such a policy would be realistic across the country. Gray used Warren’s viral zinger from the July debate in targeting the senator from Massachusetts.\\n\\nGray also jabbed at Warren over her campaign\\'s lack of a collective bargaining agreement with her staff since recognizing her campaign workers’ union in June.\\n\\nSanders also faced a bit of criticism as he met the demands from his own unionized campaign staff.\\n\\nIn another case, senior Sanders adviser Warren Gunnels took aim at Warren’s climate change plan. As Vox noted, Gunnels retweeted a tweet from a New York City councilman saying that Warren had “missed the mark.”\\n\\nAs they were battling for second place in the polls most of the summer, the Sanders campaign repeatedly insisted that former Vice President Joe Biden was the main target. The former vice president was the clear front-runner in nearly all polling from his entry into the race in late April until recent days, when a slew of new surveys suggested that Warren had tied Biden for the top spot.\\n\\nWARREN LANDS BACKING OF PROGRESSIVE GROUP THAT ENDORSED SANDERS IN HIS 2016 PRESIDENTIAL BID\\n\\nWhile Sanders kept his focus on Biden, Warren surged in polling and, in a well-publicized moment, she landed the endorsement of the progressive group the Working Families Party, which backed Sanders four years ago in his first White House bid. Meanwhile, Sanders in recent weeks has replaced a couple of key staffers in Iowa and New Hampshire, the states that kick off the presidential primary and caucus calendar.\\n\\n“They thought their opponent was Biden because they thought he was the next Hillary Clinton,” noted the progressive strategist, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely.\\n\\nThe strategist argued that the Sanders campaign failed to realize that Warren was the real threat, spotlighting that “their strategy was wrong. They were looking at Biden as the main opponent when it was really Warren.”',\n",

Twenty-five percent said they prefer former Vice President Joe Biden. Although Warren’s edge falls within the survey’s margin of error, Biden’s formidable lead over the rest of the field has crumbled since the last Quinnipiac national poll in August, which showed him with 32 percent support and Warren with 19 percent support. The latest survey reinforces other public polling showing Warren and Biden separating from their fellow contenders in the Democratic presidential race. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders ranked third in Tuesday’s poll, achieving 16 percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., with 7 percent, and California Sen. Kamala Harris at 3 percent.”\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump attacks raise doubts about Biden for Dem voters - NYT: “In public, for the last five days, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his campaign have been on a ferocious offensive, ripping into President Trump for allegedly abusing his powers in asking Ukraine’s leader to help hurt Mr. Biden politically, and castigating the news media for questioning his son Hunter Biden’s financial dealings there. … In private, though, this has been an enraging and uncertain time for the Biden campaign, and for Mr. Biden himself… He and his advisers have long feared that Hunter Biden would become a target for political opponent…And as Mr. Trump’s onslaught has pushed the House of Representatives to start an impeachment inquiry, Mr. Biden now faces a crucial political test where his standing may hinge on how he handles a wildly unpredictable confrontation with Mr. Trump.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWarren ready for air war with $10 million buy - Politico: “Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign on Tuesday announced an early-state ad campaign of at least $10 million, suggesting that the Massachusetts senator is continuing to raise big money from grass-roots donors after an anemic start. The campaign told POLITICO that a digital ad campaign would begin immediately and that they are currently reserving television time, with the entire buy ramping up over the next few months. The campaign declined to say when its spending on digital and TV ads would reach eight figures. ‘Right now, our biggest expense as a campaign is our staff, but as the campaign heats up, it will be on media to reach potential voters,’ campaign manager Roger Lau wrote in a memo emailed to supporters Tuesday morning. The campaign ‘will be more digital than old-school broadcast television.’ The campaign also released three ads Tuesday — 15-second, 30-second, and 1-minute spots — which highlight Warren’s policy plans and her intention to crack down on corruption in government.”\\n\\n\\n\\nButtigieg hitches a ride on McCain’s media strategy - CBS News: “The South Bend, Indiana mayor rolled across Iowa on a four-day bus tour and allowed everything uttered on the bus to be on the record, drawing ready comparisons to the late Senator John McCain's ‘Straight Talk Express,’ the bus he toured the country in when he ran for president in 2000. The coach, which has also been around the country in the service of former President Barack Obama, Justin Timberlake and Tom Hanks, is now styled with Buttigieg signs, marble floors and plays news channels or football in the background. … He and his campaign have ramped up spending in Iowa in the past month, releasing a new TV ad on Monday, hiring more staff on the ground and opening offices. He added that the strategy is not to ‘go around Iowa.’”\\n\\n\\n\\nSanders touts dozen of union member endorsements - The Hill: “White House hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) unveiled the endorsements of 85 union members in Iowa as he works to shore up support for his progressive bona fides against a surging Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). The endorsements were announced on the ‘Bernie beats Trump’ tour in Iowa during which Sanders is visiting counties that voted for former President Obama in 2008 and 2012 and for President Trump in 2016 to help ensure skeptical voters that he can beat Trump in a general election. … The endorsements come from members of several unions, including the autoworkers of America and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.”\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE RULEBOOK: OYEZ, OYEZ\\n\\n“The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited Constitution.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 78\\n\\n\\n\\nTIME OUT: WELL PACKAGED PEANUTS\\n\\nNew Yorker: “Timing is the life force of comics. Without a sensitivity to the rhythms and the music—a.k.a. the reality—of life, a comic strip will arrive D.O.A., nothing more than a bunch of dumb pictures. … The reader doesn’t just look at Charlie Brown, Linus, Lucy, and Snoopy but reads them as musical notes in a silently heard composition of hilarity, cruelty, and occasional melancholy. In 1950, the comics page was a more or less settled territory into which very few new features could be shoehorned, and, from the get-go, ‘Peanuts’ was marketed as a space-saver. The strip was created out of four equally sized panels, which allowed it to run horizontally, vertically, or stacked two by two. … Who would’ve thought that such a hard-nosed commercial decision would catalyze one of the greatest works of popular art of the twentieth century?”\\n\\n\\n\\nFlag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.\\n\\n\\n\\nSCOREBOARD\\n\\nDEMOCRATIC 2020 POWER RANKING\\n\\nBiden: 27.6 points (↓ 1.2 points from last wk.)\\n\\nWarren: 20.8 points (No change from last wk.)\\n\\nSanders: 16 points (↑ 1.4 points from last wk.)\\n\\nHarris: 6.6 points (↓ 0.6 points from last wk.)\\n\\nButtigieg: 5.4 points (↑ 0.4 points from last wk.)\\n\\n[Averages include: Quinnipiac University, Fox News, NBC News/WSJ, CNN and ABC News/WaPo.]\\n\\n\\n\\nTRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE\\n\\nAverage approval: 43 percent\\n\\nAverage disapproval: 54 percent\\n\\nNet Score: -11 percent\\n\\nChange from one week ago: ↑ 3.8 points\\n\\n[Average includes: Quinnipiac University: 40% approve - 55% disapprove; Fox News: 45% approve - 54% disapprove; NBC News/WSJ: 45% approve - 53% disapprove; Gallup: 43% approve - 54% disapprove; CNN: 42% approve - 54% disapprove.]\\n\\n\\n\\nWANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\\n\\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

The document also revealed that Mr. Trump, before asking Ukraine to examine actions by Mr. Biden’s son, reminded Mr. Zelensky that the U.S. sends security aid to Ukraine. ‘I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine,’ he said. ‘We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time.’ He contrasted the U.S. aid with what European countries do to help Ukraine. According to the document released by the White House on Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump didn’t make an explicit link on the call between the U.S. aid—which he had ordered a hold on a week earlier—and an investigation into Mr. Biden’s son.”\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump lawyer: State Department directed involvement - WashEx: “President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani said he began dealing with Ukrainian officials at the behest of the State Department. During an interview Tuesday evening on Fox News, Giuliani was prompted to respond to a Washington Post report in which White House insiders complained about how he was improperly ‘injecting himself’ into U.S.-Ukraine relations. ‘Man, I really did,’ Giuliani said sarcastically. ‘And you know who I did at the request of? The State Department. I never talked to a Ukrainian official until the State Department called me and asked me to do it.’ Holding up his mobile phone, Giuliani said he reported every conversation he had to the Trump administration and that evidence of this communications with the State Department were all on the device.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPelosi heats up impeachment rhetoric, but not her go-slow approach - Roll Call: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s announcement Tuesday that the House is in an ‘official impeachment inquiry’ gave no hints of how or whether it would accelerate any Democratic effort to remove President Donald Trump from office. Pelosi said she directed the six House committees conducting oversight of the Trump administration to move forward ‘under that umbrella’ of an impeachment inquiry — but gave no details about how the day-to-day approach would differ. In that way, Pelosi appeared to stay on a measured Democratic approach that for months has fallen short of raising public support for impeachment — particularly with the Trump administration’s unyielding rejection of congressional subpoena power — and put off potentially stronger moves toward impeachment.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoll shows reason for her caution - WaPo: “Amid a groundswell of support for impeachment proceedings among House Democrats, a new poll finds a majority of Americans do not favor ousting President Trump from office. Thirty-seven percent of voters say that Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 57 percent say he should not be impeached, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday morning. … The poll shows a stark partisan divide on the question of impeachment. Among Democrats, 73 percent support impeachment, while 21 percent are opposed. Among Republicans, only 4 percent support impeachment, while 95 percent are opposed. Trump’s overall job approval rating remains in the range it has for nearly his entire presidency, with 40 percent of voters approving of how he is handling his job, and 55 percent saying they disapprove.”\\n\\n\\n\\nSilver: Will Dems learn lessons of Russia probe? - FiveThirtyEight: “Despite Trump being quite unpopular, and despite the public largely buying Democrats’ interpretation of the fact pattern on Russia — most polls find that a majority of the public thinks that Trump sought to obstruct the investigation into Russia, for instance — impeachment was a soundly unpopular proposition. … The politics of impeachment on Ukraine may be different than on Russia. But Democrats should take public opinion seriously. That doesn’t mean you always have to do the poll-driven thing. But don’t wish the numbers away because you don’t like them, or presume that they’ll change in your favor, or assume there won’t be consequences for taking an unpopular action. More specifically for Democrats, their failure to persuade the public that Russia warranted impeachment offers several potential lessons if they are to proceed on Ukraine.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\\n\\nTrump reelection campaign, RNC using impeachment for fundraising haul - Politico\\n\\n\\n\\nAUDIBLE: EXCUSES, EXCUSES!\\n\\n“Now, she has so much less to push up I don’t think that’s fair.” – Chief Justice John Roberts when asked if he could keep up with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s pushups, per CNN.\\n\\n\\n\\nFROM THE BLEACHERS\\n\\n“I just have a political science question regarding the 2020 Senate race in Kansas. Kris Kobach lost the governor’s race in 2018 and is now running for the GOP nomination for Senate (yinz know this already). I was wondering do voters’ think differently when selecting a governor rather than a Senator? Kobach was too right-wing for the Topeka state House as an executive, but as a legislator in Washington? Does it make a difference that electing a Democratic Governor is vastly different than a Democratic Senator with vastly different consequences politically? Hopefully my question makes sense.” – James Belany, Pittsburgh\\n\\n\\n\\n[Ed. note: The first thing to remember, Mr. Belany, is that there’s precious little science in politics. Like many of the humanities, political theory and the study of campaigns and elections, got squeezed into a faux “science” during the middle of the last century. To that I say: Phooey! The science at play in your question could be social psychology, though. Would the voters of Kansas feel differently about a radical senator than they would a radical governor? Maybe there’s something to that. But maybe there’s another discipline to consider: Mathematics. There were three candidates for governor in 2018, but maybe only two for Senate in 2020. Could Kobach slide by in a binary election especially when Republican voters are storming the polls in a presidential year? Maybe. But that doesn’t change the fact that the GOP would much rather not have to deal with Kobach. Not only does he increase the degree of difficulty in Kansas, but Democrats running in other states can use his comments and record against his fellow Republicans.]\\n\\n\\n\\n“Just wanted you to know that I came down with a debilitating case of the bird flu this past weekend ... as the hated Cardinals swept my Cubbies at Wrigley Field, and ensured the Cardinals will be Central Division champions this year. The illness hasn't gotten better as Kris Bryant appears out for the season, and my Cubbies appear doomed to sit out the postseason. Chortle if you will at my Cubbies misfortune -- but just wait until next year!” – Stephen J. Tock, Dwight, Ill.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Ed. note: I can’t go so far as to say that I felt “bad” for the Cubs, but I can say that I admire your determination, Mr. Tock. And we can all be proud to say that the National League Central continues to be the best, most competitive division in baseball. And with three games left against the Cards, I’m sure your squad will try hard to avenge the Wrigley sweep!]\\n\\n\\n\\nShare your color commentary: Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM and please make sure to include your name and hometown.\\n\\n\\n\\nHAPPY HUMP DAY\\n\\nAP: “A veterinarian has prescribed antibiotics to a camel owned by a Louisiana truck stop petting zoo after a woman bit the 600-pound (272-kilogram) animal to free herself from under its weight. Iberville Parish Sheriff's Office documents obtained by The Advocate on Monday accuse Florida couple Gloria and Edmond Lancaster of throwing treats for their unleashed dog into Caspar the camel's enclosure at Tiger Truck Stop. The couple told deputies the camel attacked the dog, but the sheriff's office said the couple had provoked the animal before it sat on Gloria Lancaster.

       "  'text': 'The members of the progressive \"Squad\" amplified their calls for impeachment on Wednesday, rebuffing President Trump\\'s attempts to quell concerns by releasing a transcript of his phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky from July.\\n\\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., argued the transcript indicated the conversation was \"worse than we thought\" and accused the president of betraying the country.\\n\\n\"Folks, I am surprised the White House even released this transcript. It’s worse than we thought. The President sought to use the powers of the United States government to investigate a political opponent,\" she said.\\n\\nUKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, ASKED ABOUT DNC SERVER -- BUT MADE NO MENTION OF US AID\\n\\nOcasio-Cortez\\'s comments came after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced she was opening an impeachment investigation -- something the Speaker had mostly resisted until details surfaced surrounding Trump\\'s talk with Zelensky.\\n\\n\"Either the President does not know the weight of his words or he does not care about ethics or his constitutional responsibilities,\" she said in a statement Wednesday obtained by Fox News.\\n\\n“The transcript and the Justice Department’s acting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the President’s lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry. Clearly, the Congress must act.\"\\n\\nThe transcript, released on Wednesday, showed that Trump made no explicit mention of a quid pro quo exchanging U.S. foreign aid for an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden, the 2020 Democratic frontrunner, attracted scrutiny for successfully pressuring Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating a natural gas firm where his son Hunter served on the board of directors.\\n\\nAs Ocasio-Cortez noted, the transcript was not a \"verbatim\" account but was based on \"notes and recollections\" of those observing the call.\\n\\nFellow \"Squad\" member Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., joined Ocasio-Cortez in calling for impeachment, arguing that the transcript alone was proof that Congress should pursue official proceedings.\\n\\nUKRAINE CALL WHISTLEBLOWER SHOWED \\'POLITICAL BIAS,\\' FAVORED TRUMP\\'S \\'RIVAL\\' CANDIDATE: MEMO\\n\\nRep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., plainly accused Trump of trying to bribe and extort Zelensky but, in her tweet, didn\\'t point to any particular portion of the transcript.\\n\\nThe remaining \"Squad\" member, Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., enthusiastically supported impeachment on Tuesday but didn\\'t seem to comment on the released transcript via Twitter.\\n\\nHILLARY CLINTON ON UKRAINE CALL: TRUMP \\'HAS BETRAYED OUR COUNTRY\\'\\n\\nBy contrast, President Trump declared victory after the transcript\\'s release. \"Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President? They should, a perfect call - got them by surprise!\" he tweeted.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nIt seemed unlikely that Democrats would back away from impeachment since Pelosi announced the inquiry before the White House even released the transcript.

       "  'text': 'President Trump is trying to turn lemons into lemonade amid the House Democratic impeachment push against him.\\n\\nTrump’s campaign on Wednesday sent out a fundraising email that slams House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and other House Democrats for launching an impeachment inquiry after a whistleblower’s complaint suggesting Trump sought the help of a foreign government in his bid for re-election.\\n\\n“This is just another smear job and a pathetic attempt by Democrats to rip the power from the people,” the Trump campaign email stated. “I’VE DONE NOTHING WRONG. TRUST ME, YOU SAW THE TRANSCRIPT.”\\n\\nREAD THE UKRAINE CALL MEMO\\n\\nThe White House on Wednesday released a transcript of Trump’s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky showing Trump broached a review of Biden family dealings in the country. The memo begins with the president congratulating Zelensky on his election victory, before Trump eventually touches on the subject former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\\n\\n“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said in the phone call. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”\\n\\nPELOSI ANNOUNCES IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY\\n\\nThis refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board.

       "  'text': 'Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump abused his official powers \"to solicit interference\" from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election, and the White House took steps to cover it up, according to a stunning whistleblower complaint released Thursday.\\n\\nSeveral White House officials were \"deeply disturbed\" by Trump\\'s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and tried to \"lock down\" all records of the phone call, especially the word-for-word transcript produced by the White House, the complaint states.\\n\\nThe complaint has been at the center of a controversy that has spurred Democrats to launch a formal impeachment inquiry. The White House on Wednesday also released a rough transcript of the call that shows Trump repeatedly pressed Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\\n\\nCaving to Democratic demands, the Trump administration let Congress release a declassified version of the complaint, one day after releasing a rough transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call. The developments triggered a flood of Democratic lawmakers to publicly support impeachment.\\n\\nTrump has maintained that he didn\\'t do anything wrong , while simultaneously promoting unfounded conspiracy theories about the Bidens, Ukraine, and Russian meddling in 2016.\\n\\nThere is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.\\n\\nWhite House lawyers asked to remove transcript\\n\\nThe complaint notes White House lawyers were \"already in discussion\" about \"how to treat the call because of the likelihood, in the officials\\' retelling, that they had witnessed the president abuse his office for personal gain.\"\\n\\nWhite House lawyers also directed officials to remove the transcript of the call from a computer system that stores them for Cabinet-level officials and instead put the transcript in a system for especially sensitive information, the whistleblower alleges.\\n\\nThis move concerned some officials, who shared their worries internally that this was an \"abuse of the system.\"\\n\\nThe whistleblower said they heard from other White House officials that this was \"not the first time\" that the Trump administration used this storage system to hold politically sensitive documents. The codeword-level system is meant to hold files of national security importance.\\n\\nThere weren\\'t additional details in the complaint, and some of the details came from secondhand sources. Republicans on Capitol Hill have used that point to question the veracity of the complaint, though the intelligence community inspector general already deemed it credible.\\n\\nRudy Giuliani\\'s role worried State Dept officials\\n\\nUS officials were concerned, the whistleblower said, with Trump\\'s private lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his contacts with Ukrainian officials. The whistleblower alleges the US officials believed Giuliani was a conduit for messages between the President and officials in Kyiv and that he was at the helm of a problematic \"circumvention of national security decisionmaking processes.\"\\n\\nFor most of the past two years, Giuliani has played a peculiar role as Trump\\'s personal attorney, a pro-Trump surrogate on television, and as an informal diplomat of sorts. This year, he has used his position to promote conspiracy theories about Ukraine, Biden, and the 2016 election.\\n\\nThe whistleblower said they heard that two State Department officials intervened with Giuliani in an effort to \"contain the damage\" he was doing to national security. The complaint also said US diplomats worked with the new Ukrainian leaders to help them navigate the strange situation, where they juggled outreach from Giuliani with US diplomacy coming through official channels.\\n\\nState Department officials met with Ukrainian political figures and provided advice \"about how to \\'navigate\\' the demands that the President had made of\" Zelensky, the whistleblower wrote.\\n\\nLittle is known about the identity of the whistleblower, which is even still hidden from some of the most senior US intelligence officials. The Justice Department has said there are some indications that the whistleblower opposes Trump\\'s reelection, but the complaint was indeed credible. They used lawful channels to file the complaint and get the message to Congress.\\n\\nTrump potentially exposed to blackmail\\n\\nIn a letter accompanying the whistleblower\\'s complaint, Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson wrote that the alleged conduct by Trump \"would also potentially expose\" the President \"to serious national security and counterintelligence risks with respect to foreign intelligence services aware of such alleged conduct.\"\\n\\nThe implication is that US adversaries are always spying on the US and trying to intercept sensitive phone calls by US officials. If a hostile government possesses a recording or is aware of the details of Trump\\'s phone call, they could use it to blackmail Trump. The gravest risk is from Russia, which is essentially at war with Ukraine and has strong intelligence capabilities.\\n\\nAtkinson also wrote in his letter that that the whistleblower\\'s complaint amounts to a \"serious or flagrant problem [or] abuse\" under US laws regarding the inspector general\\'s office.\\n\\nThe comments were made in an August 26 letter sent to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire . Atkinson explains the reasoning behind his determination that the information amounted to an \"urgent concern,\" which triggered its eventual transmission to Congress.\\n\\nWhistleblower confused by Trump\\'s CrowdStrike interest\\n\\nThe whistleblower expresses confusion about Trump\\'s references to CrowdStrike during his calls with Zelensky. The Democratic National Committee hired CrowdStrike in 2016 to investigate hacks to its computers, which were later blamed on the Russian government.\\n\\nIn the call, Trump mentioned the US cybersecurity firm and said, \"the server, they say Ukraine has it.\" Trump also encouraged Zelensky to \"find out what happened\" with the server.\\n\\n\"I do not know why the President associates these servers with Ukraine,\" the whistleblower wrote in a footnote. The whistleblower added that Trump had previously connected the DNC server to Ukraine in television interviews.\\n\\nTrump\\'s interest in CrowdStrike and the DNC server, more than three years after the hacks, is part of a larger effort to undermine the notion that Russia meddled in the 2016 election to help him win. He has repeatedly rejected the assessment from CrowdStrike, which was later confirmed by US intelligence agencies, that Russia was behind the DNC hacks and leaks.\\n\\nThe complaint demonstrates in stark terms how people who work inside the US government, with access to highly sensitive materials, have struggled to figure out what was going on in an unconventional White House administration with a president who goes around official channels.\\n\\nThe complaint contains a blend of information that was observed firsthand, details that were provided secondhand from other officials, and information that comes from public sources, like Giuliani\\'s appearances on television and news articles about his activities surrounding Ukraine.\\n\\nThis story is breaking and will be updated.',\n",

This letter is UNCLASSIFIED when separated from the attachment.\\n\\nIn the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election. This interference includes, among other things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the President\\'s main domestic political rivals. The President\\' s personal lawyer, Mr. Rudolph Giuliani, is a central figure in this effort. Attorney General Barr appears to be involved as well.\\n\\nOver the past four months, more than half a dozen U.S. officials have informed me of various facts related to this effort.

In addition, a variety of information consistent with these private accounts has been reported publicly.\\n\\nI am deeply concerned that the actions described below constitute \"a serious or flagrant problem, abuse, or violation of law or Executive Order\" that \"does not include differences of opinions concerning public policy matters,\" consistent with the definition of an\"urgent concern\" in 50 U.S.C. §3033(k)(5)(G). I am therefore fulfilling my duty to report this information, through proper legal channels, to the relevant authorities.\\n\\nI am also concerned that these actions pose risks to U.S. national security and undermine the U.S. Government\\'s efforts to deter and counter foreign interference in U.S. elections.\\n\\nTo the best of my knowledge, the entirety of this statement is unclassified when separated from the classified enclosure. I have endeavored to apply the classification standards outlined in Executive Order (EO) 13526 and to separate out information that I know or have reason to believe is classified for national security purposes.\\n\\nIf a classification marking is applied retroactively, I believe it is incumbent upon the classifying authority to explain why such a marking was applied, and to which specific information it pertains.\\n\\nI. The 25 July Presidential phone call\\n\\nEarly in the morning of 25 July, the President spoke by telephone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. I do not know which side initiated the call. This was the first publicly acknowledged call between the two leaders since a brief congratulatory call after Mr. Zelenskyy won the presidency on 21 April.\\n\\nMultiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call informed me that, after an initial exchange of pleasantries, the President used the remainder of the call to advance his personal interests. Namely, he sought to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take actions to help the President\\'s 2020 reelection bid. According to the White House officials who had direct knowledge of the call, the President pressured Mr. Zelenskyy to, inter alia:\\n\\ninitiate or continue an investigation into the activities of former Vice President Joseph Biden and his son, Hunter Biden;\\n\\nassist in purportedly uncovering that allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election originated in Ukraine , with a specific request that the Ukrainian leader locate and turn over servers used by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and examined by the U.S. cyber security firm Crowdstrike, which initially reported that Russian hackers had penetrated the DNC\\'s networks in 2016; and\\n\\nmeet or speak with two people the President named explicitly as his personal envoys on these matters, Mr. Giuliani and Attorney General Barr, to whom the President referred multiple times in tandem.\\n\\nThe President also praised Ukraine\\'s Prosecutor General, Mr. Yuriy Lutsenko, and suggested that Mr. Zelenskyy might want to keep him in his position. (Note: Starting in March 2019, Mr. Lutsenko made a series of public allegations-many of which he later walked back -- about the Biden family\\'s activities in Ukraine, Ukrainian officials\\' purported involvement in the 2016 U.S. election, and the activities of the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv. See Part IV for additional context.)\\n\\nThe White House officials who told me this information were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call. They told me that there was already a \"discussion ongoing\" with White House lawyers about how to treat the call because of the likelihood, in the officials\\' retelling, that they had witnessed the President abuse his office for personal gain.\\n\\nThe Ukrainian side was the first to publicly acknowledge the phone call. On the evening of 25 July, a readout was posted on the website of the Ukrainian President that contained the following line (translation from original Russian-language readout):\\n\\n\"Donald Trump expressed his conviction that the new Ukrainian government will be able to quickly improve Ukraine\\'s image and complete the investigation of corruption cases that have held back cooperation between Ukraine and the United States.\"\\n\\nAside from the above-mentioned \"cases\" purportedly dealing with the Biden family and the 2016 U.S. election, I was told by White House officials that no other \"cases\" were discussed.\\n\\nBased on my understanding, there were approximately a dozen White House officials who listened to the call -- a mixture of policy officials and duty officers in the White House Situation Room, as is customary. The officials I spoke with told me that participation in the call had not been restricted in advance because everyone expected it would be a \"routine\" call with a foreign leader. I do not know whether anyone was physically present with the President during the call.\\n\\nIn addition to White House personnel, I was told that a State Department official, Mr. T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, also listened in on the call.\\n\\nI was not the only non-White House official to receive a readout of the call. Based on my understanding, multiple State Department and Intelligence Community officials were also briefed on the contents of the call as outlined above.\\n\\nII. Efforts to restrict access to records related to the call\\n\\nIn the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to \"lock down\" all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced -- as is customary -- by the White House Situation Room. This set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call.\\n\\nWhite House officials told me that they were \"directed\" by White House lawyers to remove the electronic transcript from the computer system in which such transcripts are typically stored for coordination, finalization, and distribution to Cabinet-level officials.\\n\\nInstead, the transcript was loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature. One White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.\\n\\nI do not know whether similar measures were taken to restrict access to other records of the call, such as contemporaneous handwritten notes taken by those who listened in.\\n\\nIII. Ongoing concerns\\n\\nOn 26 July, a day after the call, U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker visited Kyiv and met with President Zelenskyy and a variety of Ukrainian political figures. Ambassador Volker was accompanied in his meetings by U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland. Based on multiple readouts of these meetings recounted to me by various U.S. officials, Ambassadors Volker and Sandland reportedly provided advice to the Ukrainian leadership about how to \"navigate\" the demands that the President had made of Mr. Zelenskyy.\\n\\nI also learned from multiple U.S. officials that, on or about 2 August, Mr. Giuliani reportedly traveled to Madrid to meet with one of President Zelenskyy\\' s advisers, Andriy Yermak. The U.S. officials characterized this meeting, which was not reported publicly at the time, as a \"direct follow-up\" to the President\\'s call with Mr. Zelenskyy about the \"cases\" they had discussed.\\n\\nSeparately, multiple U.S. officials told me that Mr. Giuliani had reportedly privately reached out to a variety of other Zelenskyy advisers, including Chief of Staff Andriy Bohdan and Acting Chairman of the Security Service of Ukraine Ivan Bakanov.\\n\\nI do not know whether those officials met or spoke with Mr. Giuliani, but I was told separately by multiple U.S. officials that Mr. Yermak and Mr. Bakanov intended to travel to Washington in mid-August.\\n\\nOn 9 August, the President told reporters: \"I think [President Zelenskyy] is going to make a deal with President Putin, and he will be invited to the White House. And we look forward to seeing him. He\\'s already been invited to the White House, and he wants to come. And I think he will. He\\'s a very reasonable guy. He wants to see peace in Ukraine, and I think he will be coming very soon, actually.\"\\n\\nIV. Circumstances leading up to the 25 July Presidential phone call\\n\\nBeginning in late March 2019, a series of articles appeared in an online publication called The Hill. In these articles, several Ukrainian officials -- most notably, Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko -- made a series of allegations against other Ukrainian officials and current and former\\n\\nU.S. officials. Mr. Lutsenko and his colleagues alleged, inter alia:\\n\\nthat they possessed evidence that Ukrainian officials -- namely, Head of the National Anticorruption Bureau of Ukraine Artem Sytnyk and Member of Parliament Serhiy Leshchenko -- had \"interfered\" in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, allegedly in collaboration with the DNC and the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv;\\n\\nthat the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv -- specifically, U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who had criticized Mr. Lutsenko\\' s organization for its poor record on fighting corruption -- had allegedly obstructed Ukrainian law enforcement agencies\\' pursuit of corruption cases, including by providing a \"do not prosecute\" list, and had blocked Ukrainian prosecutors from traveling to the United States expressly to prevent them from delivering their \"evidence\" about the 2016 U.S. election; and\\n\\nthat former Vice President Biden had pressured former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in 2016 to fire then Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin in order to quash a purported criminal probe into Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company on whose board the former Vice President\\'s son, Hunter, sat.\\n\\nIn several public comments, Mr. Lutsenko also stated that he wished to communicate directly with Attorney General Barr on these matters.\\n\\nThe allegations by Mr. Lutsenko came on the eve of the first round of Ukraine\\'s presidential election on 31 March. By that time, Mr. Lutsenko\\'s political patron, President Poroshenko, was trailing Mr. Zelenskyy in the polls and appeared likely to be defeated. Mr. Zelenskyy had made known his desire to replace Mr. Lutsenko as Prosecutor General. On 21 April, Mr. Poroshenko lost the runoff to Mr. Zelenskyy by a landslide. See Enclosure for additional information.\\n\\nIt was also publicly reported that Mr. Giuliani had met on at least two occasions with Mr. Lutsenko: once in New York in late January and again in Warsaw in mid-February. In addition, it was publicly reported that Mr. Giuliani had spoken in late 2018 to former Prosecutor General Shokin, in a Skype call arranged by two associates of Mr. Giuliani. to\\n\\nOn 25 April in an interview with Fox News, the President called Mr. Lutsenko\\'s claims \"big\" and \"incredible\" and stated that the Attorney General \"would want to see this.\"\\n\\nOn or about 29 April, I learned from U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the situation that Ambassador Yovanovitch had been suddenly recalled to Washington by senior State Department officials for \"consultations\" and would most likely be removed from her position.\\n\\nAround the same time, I also learned from a U.S. official that \"associates\" of Mr. Giuliani were trying to make contact with the incoming Zelenskyy team.\\n\\nOn 6 May, the State Department announced that Ambassador Yovanovitch would be ending her assignment in Kyiv \"as planned.\"\\n\\nHowever, several U.S. officials told me that, in fact, her tour was curtailed because of pressure stemming from Mr. Lutsenko\\'s allegations. Mr. Giuliani subsequently stated in an interview with a Ukrainian journalist published on 14 May that Ambassador Yovanovitch was \"removed ... because she was part of the efforts against the President.\"\\n\\nOn 9 May, The New York Times reported that Mr. Giuliani planned to travel to Ukraine to press the Ukrainian government to pursue investigations that would help the President in his 2020 reelection bid.\\n\\nIn his multitude of public statements leading up to and in the wake of the publication of this article, Mr. Giuliani confirmed that he was focused on encouraging Ukrainian authorities to pursue investigations into alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and alleged wrongdoing by the Biden family. 12\\n\\nOn the afternoon of 10 May, the President stated in an interview with Politico that he planned to speak with Mr. Giuliani about the trip.\\n\\nA few hours later, Mr. Giuliani publicly canceled his trip, claiming that Mr. Zelenskyy was \"surrounded by enemies of the [U.S.] President... and of the United States.\"\\n\\nOn 11 May, Mr. Lutsenko met for two hours with President-elect Zelenskyy, according to a public account given several days later by Mr. Lutsenko. Mr. Lutsenko publicly stated that he had told Mr. Zelenskyy that he wished to remain as Prosecutor General.\\n\\nStarting in mid-May, I heard from multiple U.S. officials that they were deeply concerned by what they viewed as Mr. Giuliani\\'s circumvention of national security decisionmaking processes to engage with Ukrainian officials and relay messages back and forth between Kyiv and the President. These officials also told me:\\n\\nthat State Department officials, including Ambassadors Volker and Sondland, had spoken with Mr. Giulianiin an attempt to \"contain the damage\" to U.S. national security; and\\n\\nthat Ambassadors Volker and Sandland during this time period met with members of the new Ukrainian administration and, in addition to discussing policy matters, sought to help Ukrainian leaders understand and respond to the differing messages they were receiving from official U.S. channels on the-one-hand, and from Mr. Giuliani on the other.\\n\\nDuring this same timeframe, multiple U.S. officials told me that the Ukrainian leadership was led to believe that a meeting or phone call between the President and President Zelenskyy would depend on whether Zelenskyy showed willingness to \" play ball\" on the issues that had been publicly aired by Mr. Lutsenko and Mr. Giuliani. (Note: This was the general understanding of the state of affairs as conveyed to me by U.S. officials from late May into early July. I do not know who delivered this message to the Ukrainian leadership, or when.) See Enclosure for additional information.\\n\\nShortly after President Zelenskyy\\' s inauguration, it was publicly reported that Mr. Giuliani met with two other Ukrainian officials: Ukraine\\'s Special Anticorruption Prosecutor, Mr. Nazar Kholodnytskyy, and a former Ukrainian diplomat named Andriy Telizhenko. Both Mr. Kholodnytskyy and Mr. Telizhenko are allies of Mr. Lutsenko and made similar allegations in the above-mentioned series of articles in The Hill.\\n\\nOn 13 June, the President told ABC\\' s George Stephanopoulos that he would accept damaging information on his political rivals from a foreign government.\\n\\nOn 21 June, Mr. Giuliani tweeted: \"New Pres of Ukraine still silent on investigation of Ukrainian interference in 2016 and alleged Biden bribery of Poroshenko. Time for leadership and investigate both if you want to purge how Ukraine was abused by Hillary and Clinton people.\"\\n\\nIn mid-July, I learned of a sudden change of policy with respect to U.S. assistance for Ukraine. See Enclosure for additional information.\\n\\nENCLOSURE: Classified appendix\\n\\n(U) CLASSIFIED APPENDIX\\n\\n(U) Supplementary classified information is provided as follows:\\n\\n(U) Additional information related to Section II\\n\\nAccording to multiple White House officials I spoke with, the transcript of the President\\'s call with President Zelenskyy was placed into a computer system managed directly by the National Security Council (NSC) Directorate for Intelligence Programs. This is a standalone computer system reserved for codeword-level intelligence information , such as covert action. According to information I received from White House officials, some officials voiced concerns internally that this would be an abuse of the system and was not consistent with the responsibilities of the Directorate for Intelligence Programs. According to White House officials I spoke with, this was \"not the first time\" under this Administration that a Presidential transcript was placed into this codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive — rather than national security sensitive — information .\\n\\n(U) Additional information related to Section IV\\n\\n[Redaction]\\n\\nI would like to expand upon two issues mentioned in Section IV that might have a connection with the overall effort to pressure the Ukrainian leadership. As I do not know definitively whether the below-mentioned decisions are connected to the broader efforts I describe, I have chosen to include them in the classified annex. If they indeed represent genuine policy deliberations and decisions formulated to advance U.S. foreign policy and national security, one might be able to make a reasonable case that the facts are classified',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington (CNN) America\\'s top spy broke with Donald Trump and his Republican supporters Thursday, defending a whistleblower and intelligence committee watchdog who exposed contacts with Ukraine that could help lead to the President\\'s impeachment.\\n\\n\"I believe that the whistleblower and the inspector general have acted in good faith throughout. I have every reason to believe that they have done everything by the book and followed the law,\" said acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire , testifying before a key House committee.\\n\\nBut Maguire declined to say whether he spoke to the President about the whistleblower complaint that alleged that Trump solicited the help of Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election and that White House officials tried to hide his conduct, in the latest twist of a fast-escalating drama that has turned into the most serious crisis of Trump\\'s presidency.\\n\\n\"I am not partisan and I am not political,\" said Maguire, a former Navy SEAL commander who served eight presidents in uniform and was not a well-known public figure until he was thrust into the glare of the scandal.\\n\\nDemocrats used the high profile forum to accuse the President of abusing his power and endangering national security. Republicans tried to pick holes in the complaint, noting that the unidentified whistleblower admitted not having first-hand knowledge of events including Trump\\'s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\\n\\nUnder intense pressure from Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, Maguire also acknowledged that his office consulted with the White House counsel\\'s office after receiving a complaint detailing allegations about Trump\\'s communications with Ukraine , because calls with foreign leaders usually fall under executive privilege.\\n\\nMaguire had been accused before the hearing of caving into White House pressure not to follow the law and turn over a complaint that the intelligence community\\'s inspector general deemed \"urgent and credible.\"\\n\\nThe acting DNI repeatedly defended his handling of the complaint, telling lawmakers he followed the law in an \"unprecedented\" situation, despite claims to the contrary by Democrats that he infringed on their right to review the allegations.\\n\\nHis appearance before the committee and a closed door briefing before the Senate panel, came a day after lawmakers had their first chance to see the classified account that spurred Democrats to launch a formal impeachment inquiry. The account was declassified and released Thursday morning.\\n\\nAllegations of a \\'coverup\\'\\n\\nThe complaint states that several White House officials were \"deeply disturbed\" by Trump\\'s July 25 phone call with Zelensky and tried to \"lock down\" all records of the phone call, especially the word-for-word transcript produced by the White House.\\n\\nMaguire said during his testimony he did not have the authority to waive the executive privilege that covered the conversation with Ukraine\\'s President and would not say whether he discussed the complaint with Trump.\\n\\n\"My conversations with the President, because I\\'m the director of national intelligence, are privileged, and it would be inappropriate for me, because it would destroy my relationship with the President in intelligence matters, to divulge any of my conversations with the President of the United States,\" Maguire said responding to a question from Rep. Jim Himes, a Connecticut Democrat.\\n\\nBut in a tense exchange with Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, Maguire conceded that \"there is an allegation of a coverup.\"\\n\\n\"But right now, all we have is an allegation — an allegation with second hand information from a whistleblower. I have no knowledge on whether or not that is true and accurate statement,\" he said.\\n\\nWhen asked later in the hearing if Trump asked him to disclose the identity of the whistleblower, Maguire told lawmakers,\" I can tell you emphatically, no.\"\\n\\nHe also said no one else within the White House or DOJ asked him to identify the whistleblower.\\n\\nWhite House consulted after complaint\\n\\nInitially, Maguire seemed to waver about the chronology of events related to his handling of the complaint but ultimately told lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee that his office did seek guidance from the White House before raising the issue with the Office of Legal Counsel and Department of Justice, which advised he was not legally bound to provide it to the committee.\\n\\n\"Such calls are typically subject to executive privilege, as a result we consulted with the White House counsel\\'s office and were advised that much of the information of the complaint was in fact subject to executive privilege,\" Maguire said. \"A privilege that I do not have the authority to waive. Because of that we were unable to immediately share the details of the complaint with this committee.\"\\n\\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence has provided a redacted version to Congress that members can bring to an open hearing, a spokesperson said.\\n\\nThe anticipation ahead of Maguire\\'s testimony was also amplified by the White House\\'s decision to release a transcript of Trump\\'s July 25 phone call with the leader of Ukraine that shows the President repeatedly pressed his counterpart to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.\\n\\nThe conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is included in the whistleblower complaint, a source familiar with the situation said last week, a revelation that only raised more questions in the ongoing controversy.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared the President had betrayed his oath of office and announced she is opening a formal impeachment inquiry , a move that has raised the stakes of this week\\'s events.\\n\\nHouse Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, started the hearing by accusing Trump of betraying his oath of office and compromising US national security for Trump\\'s \"personal, political benefit,\" referring to the conduct outlined in the call transcript released Wednesday.\\n\\n\"It forces us to confront the remedy the founders provided for such a flagrant abuse of office: impeachment. Now this matter would not have come to the attention of our committee or the nation\\'s attention without the courage of a single person- the whistleblower,\" he said.\\n\\nGOP members question whistleblower\\'s claim\\n\\nRepublicans, however, keyed in to the fact that the whistleblower acknowledged they did not have firsthand knowledge of most of the events described in the complaint.\\n\\n\"I was not a direct witness to most of the events described,\" the whistleblower wrote, noting that they were aware of details in the complaint pertaining to Trump\\'s July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian President because of \"White House officials with direct knowledge of the call.\"\\n\\nBut the public now has a way to test the accuracy of at least part of the whistleblower\\'s complaint by comparing the details related to that call to the transcript released by the White House Wednesday. By all appearances, the information is consistent.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Nunes to Maguire: They will use these words against you Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Nunes to Maguire: They will use these words against you 02:57\\n\\nIn his testimony Thursday, Maguire continued to defend his handling of the whistleblower complaint , saying he was told by the Department of Justice it did \"not meet the statutory requirement of \\'urgent concern,\\'\" required to transmit to Congress and insisted that decision was \"binding.\"\\n\\n\"After reviewing the complaint, and the inspector general\\'s transmittal letter, the office of legal counsel determined that the complaint\\'s allegations do not meet the statutory requirement definition (of) legal, urgent concern, and found that I was not legally required to transmit the material to our oversight committee,\" he added.\\n\\nLast week, Maguire refused to comply with a deadline to hand over a whistleblower complaint to the House Intelligence Committee that had been deemed by the intelligence community inspector general to be \"credible and urgent,\" a conclusion that drove his push to provide Congress with the details and refer the matter to the Justice Department for consideration of criminality.\\n\\nMaguire suggested during his testimony that he understood the importance of the complaint itself.\\n\\n\"I realized ... full and well the importance of the allegation,\" Maguire said, adding later, \"when I saw that, I anticipated having to sit in front of some committee some time to discuss it.\"\\n\\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington (CNN) The Justice Department\\'s Office of Legal Counsel essentially ignored some allegations from a whistleblower complaint regarding President Donald Trump\\'s communications with Ukraine when it decided not to forward the complaint to Congress, according to a newly unsealed memo from the department\\'s policy office.\\n\\nSteven Engel of the Office of Legal Counsel was charged with examining whether the whistleblower complaint was indeed an \"urgent concern\" under the law. The Office of Legal Counsel, the first unit within the Justice Department to learn of the whistleblower\\'s complaint, decided it was not of urgent concern, based largely around analysis of Trump\\'s July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. Engel had addressed the legal question -- one centered around the call itself and less focused on the whistleblower\\'s other allegations -- that the intelligence community inspector general had originally addressed and sent up the chain.\\n\\nHis determination in the now-declassified September 3 opinion advised the Director of National Intelligence to keep the whistleblower complaint within the Justice Department for a possible criminal probe instead of sending it to congressional lawmakers.\\n\\nBut the original September 3 memo also acknowledges the whistleblower\\'s accusations that Trump chose to suspend security assistance to Ukraine because of an improper motive, and that White House officials attempted to lock down the transcript of the Zelensky call out of political concerns. Those accusations, however, were not part of the OLC\\'s main considerations and instead appeared only in the memo\\'s footnotes.\\n\\nThe Office of Legal Counsel posted the redacted September 3 memo on its website Thursday morning, noting it is now declassified.\\n\\nRead More',\n",

       "  'text': 'It\\'s come up this week in connection to President Donald Trump\\'s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to a White House transcript of the call, Trump asked for a \"favor\" -- help from Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 contender.\\n\\n\"The quid pro quo is in the President\\'s words,\" Democratic Rep. John Garamendi of California argued on CNN\\'s \"New Day\" Friday, telling John Berman that Trump\\'s phone call with Zelensky \"makes it very clear.\"\\n\\n\"That together with withholding the funds, which preceded the phone call. All of these things are there. And that\\'s not circumstantial,\" Garamendi said.\\n\\nCNN chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin argued on CNN Wednesday that there\\'s \"very strong evidence that there was a quid pro quo here\" in Trump\\'s phone call.\\n\\nToobin pointed to the section of the White House transcript in which Zelensky mentioned that Ukraine was ready to buy more Javelin missiles from the US. Trump replied, \"I would like you to do us a favor.\"\\n\\n\"He raises that at the precise moment after Zelensky raises the issue of we need money for our defense,\" Toobin said. \"Money, favor. Quid pro quo.\"\\n\\nTrump on early Wednesday, after the rough transcript was released, denied any wrongdoing, saying there was \"no pressure whatsoever\" in his phone call with Zelensky. At a separate afternoon news conference in New York, the President added: \"I didn\\'t do it. There was no quid pro quo.\"\\n\\nThe rough transcript, a senior White House official said, was developed with assistance from voice recognition software along with note takers and experts listening.\\n\\nLawmakers spar over issue of quid pro quo\\n\\nA majority of Republicans fell in line with the White House\\'s argument that the call summary did not provide proof of an explicit quid pro quo.\\n\\n\"There is no quid pro quo, no this for that. Nowhere does the President say that he will withhold military aid unless the Ukraine investigation continues. It\\'s simply not there,\" Republican Rep. Ross Spano of Florida, a former lawyer, argued on the House floor Wednesday.\\n\\nBut Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-New York, also a former lawyer who spoke after Spano, said, \"You don\\'t need to state an explicit quid pro quo when you have conducted the quid pro quo, when you have withheld the military aid.\"\\n\\nHouse Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said at a news conference Wednesday that the President\\'s call amounted to a \"classic Mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader.\"\\n\\n\"The President of Ukraine brought up his country\\'s need for military assistance and immediately thereafter the President of the United States said, I have a favor I want to ask of you,\\' and would not let the subject go. There was only one message that that president of Ukraine got from that call,\" Schiff said.\\n\\nDid Trump violate law?\\n\\nFederal election campaign law makes it a crime for a foreign national -- directly or indirectly -- \"to make a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value\" and for \"a person to solicit, accept, or receive a contribution or donation...from a foreign national.\"\\n\\nThe phone call between Trump and Zelensky was part of a whistleblower complaint to the intelligence community inspector general, and eventually was alerted to the Justice Department.\\n\\nThe Justice Department determined last week that there was no reason for a full-blown finance criminal investigation. What the President asked of Zelensky doesn\\'t amount to a quantifiable \"thing of value\" under campaign finance law, top administration officials determined\\n\\nThe whistleblower complaint publicly released Thursday alleges that Trump abused his official powers \"to solicit interference\" from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election, and the White House took steps to cover it up.\\n\\nWhite House lawyers were in discussion about \"how to treat the call because of the likelihood, in the officials\\' retelling, that they had witnessed the president abuse his office for personal gain,\" the complaint says.\\n\\n\"Looking at the document as a whole, that certainly could be implied,\" George Washington law professor John Banzhaf told CNN on Thursday. \"Whether or not it could be implied and the proof is strong enough to meet a criminal standard ... the answer is probably no. But if in a civil context where the standard is much lower ... I think the answer would be clearly yes.\"\\n\\nBanzhaf told CNN on Thursday that it doesn\\'t make any difference whether there is a quid pro quo or not.\\n\\n\"It still arguably would violate the federal election law, and therefore would be a crime,\" Banzhaf said. He added: \"When Trump asked for this information, that by itself probably violates the statute, even if there\\'s no quid pro quo.\"\\n\\nBanzhaf also noted that \"thing of value\" has been interpreted \"very, very broadly.\"\\n\\n\"It is not just money, or a flight on an airplane, or even a data set. It\\'s anything which may be of a value to somebody else and might persuade them to do something,\" Banzhaf said, adding later, \"Pretty certainly, information which would be damaging to a possible political opponent, which would be Biden, would meet the criteria of a \\'thing of value.\\'\"\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Toobin had also argued that quid pro quo isn\\'t necessary for the call to be \"wildly inappropriate and potentially impeachable.\"\\n\\n\"The very notion of asking a foreign leader for dirt on a political opponent, independent of the issue of quid pro quo, is troubling to many, many people,\" Toobin said on CNN.\\n\\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Friday.',\n",

       "  'text': '(CNN) The highly anticipated whistleblower report regarding President Donald Trump and his conversations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shook Washington on Thursday as the public rushed to read the nine-page document. But some of the most influential people on Capitol Hill -- Senate Republicans -- didn\\'t have much to say in the hours after it came out.\\n\\nMany Senate Republicans said on Thursday that they haven\\'t read the whistleblower complaint yet. Others said the complaint doesn\\'t change things and raises \"more questions than answers.\"\\n\\nHere\\'s what they told reporters about the complaint:\\n\\nOklahoma Sen. James Lankford and North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven each said they were in appropriations mark-ups and hadn\\'t yet read the full complaint.\\n\\nIndiana Sen. Mike Braun said he hadn\\'t read it either, adding that he didn\\'t know about the allegations to \"lock down\" information at the White House. Braun went on to say that he didn\\'t feel the complaint would change Republicans\\' views of impeachment, and said the Democrats had made a mistake starting an impeachment inquiry before knowing more about the complaint.\\n\\nTennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander said he has not read the complaint. \"I\\'m waiting for the intelligence committee to finish its work.\"\\n\\nOhio Sen. Rob Portman said he said he\\'s been \"running around\" all day and hasn\\'t read it and would not comment.\\n\\nArkansas Sen. Tom Cotton said \"no comment\" twice and boarded a senators-only elevator when asked if he was concerned the White House was locking down information.\\n\\nMissouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said, \"We\\'re committed to gather the information before we reach conclusions. Other people who don\\'t have this responsibility can reach conclusions right away,\" Blunt said. \"In my case I\\'m not ready to make any conclusions yet and still ready to gather more information.\"\\n\\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio told reporters he has read the whistleblower\\'s complaint, and says he has \"more questions than answers.\"\\n\\nIdaho Sen. Jim Risch, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that there was \"nothing there\" when asked about the rough transcript of Trump\\'s call with the Ukrainian leader. On the whistleblower complaint, he said that he prefers to look at the primary document, meaning the rough transcript.\\n\\nSouth Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds said \"they are using second-hand information right now. Let\\'s let the committee investigate it.\"\\n\\nIowa Sen. Joni Ernst said she hasn\\'t had time to read the whole complaint, saying, \"I am going to have to dig into it.\"\\n\\nSen. Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said after his panel heard testimony from acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire that \"this will generate more questions than we asked today. The next two weeks we\\'ll probably be trying to get answers to those,\" referencing the two-week Senate recess that began Thursday. \"Don\\'t expect us to move at lightspeed -- that will probably happen in the House. But the committee is committed to make sure we get to the bottom of questions (that) need answers.\"\\n\\nSen. Susan Collins, of Maine, said the hearing was a \"worthwhile discussion\" and \"there are obviously a lot of questions\" coming out of it.\\n\\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina raised doubts Friday about the intelligence community whistleblower\\'s complaint because it includes \"hearsay\" that \"brings everything into question.\" \"First, I would suggest that since it\\'s a whistleblower who was not really there, it\\'s not really a whistleblower. So, it\\'s really more hearsay,\" Scott said.\\n\\nSen. John Cornyn of Texas defended Trump as well, questioning the whistleblower. \"How can you be a whistleblower if you are merely relying what other, unnamed people are telling you, i.e., no personal knowledge?\" Cornyn tweeted.\\n\\nThis story will be updated with more reactions as they become available.',\n",

       "  'text': 'New York (CNN) Diplomats are rallying to the support of former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch after the release of a whistleblower complaint shed further light on the circumstances of her unexpected removal.\\n\\nThe allegations raised in the complaint, in combination with President Donald Trump\\'s comments about the career diplomat revealed in the White House transcript of a call between Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart, lend further credence to the claim that Yovanovitch\\'s removal from her post last May was politically motivated.\\n\\nTwo major groups representing the diplomatic community issued statements on Thursday with the American Academy of Diplomacy stating that Trump\\'s comments are \"deeply troubling.\"\\n\\nYovanovitch, a career member of the foreign service and who has served in ambassadorships under three presidents, was sworn in as ambassador to Ukraine in August 2016.\\n\\nIn May 2019, Yovanovitch was recalled to Washington, months earlier than expected. The State Department said at the time that Yovanovitch was \"concluding her 3-year diplomatic assignment as planned\" and that her departure aligned with the presidential transition in Ukraine.\\n\\nHowever, the whistleblower cast doubt on that claim, writing in a complaint that \"several US officials told me that, in fact, her tour was curtailed because of pressure stemming from\" allegations by the then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko -- the prosecutor with whom Rudy Giuliani had met to discuss \"collusion.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Giuliani subsequently stated in an interview with a Ukrainian journalist published on 14 May that Ambassador Yovanovitch was \\'removed ... because she was part of the efforts against the President,\\'\" the whistleblower wrote.\\n\\n\\'The Achilles heel\\' of Ukraine\\n\\nYovanovitch was strongly committed to US foreign policy objectives in that country and outspoken in highlighting corruption in there, according to numerous former officials.\\n\\n\"She understood that corruption was the \\'Achilles heel,\\' so to speak, of Ukraine,\" a former State Department official who knows Yovanovitch told CNN Thursday prior to the release of the complaint. \"And so Masha, by doubling down on corruption and making it kind of her leitmotif of her tenure as ambassador, was doing exactly what she should have been doing and what US policy has been in Ukraine for quite some time.\"\\n\\nThat mission likely earned her Luksenko\\'s ire. In late March, he claimed to The Hill\\'s John Solomon that Yovanovitch had given \"a list of people whom we should not prosecute.\" The State Department denied Lutsenko\\'s claim, and Lutsenko later walked it back.\\n\\nNonetheless, Yovanovitch remained under fire by conservative outlets and figures. Donald Trump Jr. tweeted on March 24, \"We need more \\u2066@RichardGrenell\\'s and less of these jokers as ambassadors,\" along with a link to an article from the conservative \"Daily Wire\" on growing calls for her to be ousted Giuliani has claimed without evidence on numerous occasions that Yovanovitch had impeded his investigation in Ukraine and has tied this baseless claim to a conspiracy theory involving funding from the billionaire George Soros.\\n\\nThe former State Department official said that \"the fact that agents of the President, whether they be his son or Giuliani, should somehow be dragged into this mess on behalf of people who are unworthy and dubious at best is really distressing.\"\\n\\n\"We saw the knives were out for Masha but it was still shocking that she was forced to depart her post just weeks before she was going to go anyway,\" retired US Ambassador James Melville told CNN Wednesday. \"That\\'s just such a sign of disrespect, and almost contempt for career officers and diplomacy.\"\\n\\nCNN has reached out to Yovanovitch for comment.\\n\\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday said he had not yet read the whistleblower complaint.\\n\\n\\'Deeply troubling\\'\\n\\nTrump disparaged Yovanovitch in a call with his Ukrainian counterpart, a White House transcript released on Wednesday revealed.\\n\\n\"The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let you know that,\" Donald Trump told Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 call, according to a White House transcript released Wednesday.\\n\\nZelensky, who was elected in April 2019, echoed the US President\\'s sentiment, saying \"I agree with you 100%.\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s going to go through some things,\" Trump added.\\n\\nThe American Academy of Diplomacy on Thursday said they noted Trump\\'s comments -- particularly his remark that \"she\\'s going to go through some things\" -- \"with great concern.\"\\n\\n\"The threatening tone of this statement is deeply troubling,\" said AAD Chairman Thomas Pickering and AAD President Ronald Neumann, both of whom are retired ambassadors.\\n\\n\"It suggests actions outside of and contrary to the procedures and standards of a professional service whose officers, like their military counterparts, take an oath to uphold the Constitution,\" they said in a statement. \"Whatever views the Administration has of Ambassador Yovanovitch\\'s performance, we call on the Administration to make clear that retaliation for political reasons will not be tolerated.\\n\\nIn a statement Thursday, the American Foreign Service Association called \"on all Americans to honor and respect the non-partisan, non-political work of the dedicated public servants of the U.S. Foreign Service.\"\\n\\n\"Our country needs a professional, non-partisan Foreign Service,\" the statement said. \"Our members pledge their lives to service to their country and its interests. Any attack on their integrity and commitment to non-partisan service does a great disservice to them, to their families and to our country.\"\\n\\n\\'One of the best\\'\\n\\nThose who worked with Yovanovitch praised her experience and skill, and multiple former officials told CNN they thought she was an ideal choice for ambassador to Ukraine.\\n\\n\"Masha (Yovanovitch) knows that part of the world so well, speaks the languages, knows the issues cold,\" Melville said. \"They couldn\\'t have had a better ambassador than Masha.\"\\n\\nRetired US ambassador Nicholas Burns on Wednesday described Yovanovich as \"extremely effective,\" \"highly ethical\" and \"a person of high character.\"\\n\\nHe also decried the President\\'s comments about the longtime foreign service officer.\\n\\n\"It is so unprofessional of the President to do that -- to throw a US government employee under the bus, someone as distinguished as Ambassador Yovanovitch is,\" he told CNN. Burns, who served in the US government for nearly three decades, said he had not seen anything like it.\\n\\n\"It\\'s injurious to morale and you can imagine how career people feel when they see one of the best people that we have, Masha Yovanovitch, treated like this,\" he said.\\n\\nHe called for \"the higher levels of the State Department\" to \"come out and defend her.\"\\n\\n\"They should say she was a good ambassador, she did what was asked. She did what her constitutional duty asked her to do, represent the United States ably and honorably,\" Burns said. \"She deserves an apology, a public apology.\"',\n",

       "  'text': '(CNN) Vulnerable House Democrats privately met with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday to air out their views about the impeachment process, including some still resistant to the notion of impeaching President Donald Trump.\\n\\nDuring the meeting, several members made clear their stance that Democrats should keep the inquiry focused on the Ukraine matter -- allegations that Trump asked the Ukrainian President to initiate an investigation into a potential 2020 political rival -- and not the other instances of potential wrongdoing detailed in the report from special counsel Robert Mueller\\n\\nDemocrats are largely in agreement about the strategy, with Pelosi saying during her press conference on Thursday morning that the whistleblower complaint is \"the focus of the moment.\"\\n\\nBy keeping the impeachment inquiry focused, leaders hope to keep the caucus unified -- with an eye to the moderate members who only recently joined calls for proceedings. The Ukraine matter is also relatively clear-cut and easy to explain to the public, lawmakers say. They also argue the probe, spearheaded by the intelligence committee, will be able to move faster -- possibly in the next month or two -- with a narrower scope.\\n\\nRep. Angie Craig, a vulnerable freshman Democrat from Minnesota, who said earlier this week that she supported the impeachment inquiry said after the meeting that Pelosi and Democratic leaders mostly listened to the views raised by the lawmakers.\\n\\n\"I\\'m in a district where I\\'ve been reluctant to move forward only from the perspective where I want to be disciplined, I want to look at due process and want to make sure we get all of our facts -- and this process will allow us to do that,\" Craig said, adding she backed a narrow probe led by the House Intelligence Committee\\n\\nRep. Matt Cartwright, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, told CNN that he wouldn\\'t -- at this point -- vote for articles of impeachment\\n\\n\"I would vote no right now because we haven\\'t seen all the facts,\" Cartwright said. \"We have to presume that people are innocent, don\\'t we, and we have to see if what the press has been reporting and what has been revealed in terms of documentation, if if all that is true.\"\\n\\nDemocrats will hear from constituents about their moves toward impeachment soon, with members scheduled to return to their districts for a two-week recess at the start of October. It will be the first time a swath of members from more conservative districts will receive clear, in-person feedback -- or, in some cases, blowback -- from the people they represent since they joined calls for impeachment proceedings in the wake of the Ukraine allegations earlier this week.\\n\\nBut Rep. Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat, said the timing of the recess has its upsides.\\n\\n\"I really can\\'t think of a better thing to do than to sort of check in with the boss before we move forward,\" he told reporters. \"It\\'s actually good timing that we get a chance to go home, catch our breath, get the perspective of people back home, explain what we\\'re doing, and then come back and move forward accordingly.\"\\n\\nOnce lawmakers return, though, movement is likely to be quick.\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s everybody\\'s intention here to get this done in 2019,\" said Rep. Jamie Raskin, an impeachment advocate and member of the Judiciary Committee.\\n\\n\"The caucus is unified around the lawlessness and corruption pouring forth from the White House, and our job will be to reduce it to a set of articles of impeachment that make sense to the country,\" the Maryland Democrat told reporters on Thursday night. \"We need a set of articles that make a compelling legal case and that tell a coherent story to the public. And if we do our job right, it will be a unifying exercise for the whole country.\"\\n\\nRep. Anthony Brindisi, a freshman from New York who has resisted calls for an impeachment probe, told CNN that he\\'s \"not yet\" there on impeaching Trump.\\n\\n\"While I find many of the statements in the whistleblower\\'s report disturbing, there\\'s a lot more information that\\'s out there,\" Brindisi said. \"We have to talk to some of these officials that they have listed in the report here and see where it goes.\"\\n\\nMore than half the members of the US House of Representatives have said they support an impeachment inquiry, according to a CNN count . However, that count includes many Democrats who say they support an impeachment investigation but are still waiting for the results of the probe before deciding whether to finally vote to impeach Trump. Even if the House could pass the vote, it likely would go nowhere in the Republican-controlled Senate, one of many reasons the issue has been politically divisive in the party.\\n\\nStill there has been a surge in support -- more than 75 House members in about three days -- of launching such an inquiry as part of the fallout from Trump\\'s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky where he discussed former Vice President Joe Biden. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, in tense testimony Thursday on Capitol Hill, defended his handling of the explosive whistleblower complaint alleging President Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the Biden family -- while calling the matter \"unprecedented.\"\\n\\nBut after maintaining his composure for most of the morning, his frustration showed through at the end, when House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., repeatedly pressed him to agree that the matter should be investigated.\\n\\nREAD THE WHISTLEBLOWER\\'S COMPLAINT\\n\\nMaguire stressed that the committee now has all of the relevant information, including the whistleblower complaint itself that was released publicly Thursday morning, and said it\\'s up to them to decide how to proceed.\\n\\n“The horse has left the barn,” Maguire said. “You have all of the information. You have the whistleblower complaint. You have the letter from the ICIG. You have the Office of Legal Counsel opinion and you have the transcript from the president.”\\n\\nMaguire also stressed that the complaint was essentially \"hearsay\" and not “corroborated by other folks.”\\n\\n“This is second-hand information. I am not criticizing the whistleblower,” Maguire said. “... I am in no position to tell the committee to do an investigation or not to do an investigation.”\\n\\nSchiff vowed at the end \"we are gonna find out\" the backstory, including whether U.S. aid was tied in any way to Trump\\'s investigation request, which the president denies.\\n\\nThe combative conclusion of the session reflected the high tensions and enormous stakes surrounding Maguire\\'s appearance. The rare open hearing of the intelligence committee commanded Washington\\'s political attention given the implications for the newly launched impeachment inquiry against Trump, related to the whistleblower complaint.\\n\\nShortly after the hearing ended, Trump fired back on Twitter, saying: “Adam Schiff has zero credibility. Another fantasy to hurt the Republican Party!”\\n\\nHe told reporters that the process is a “disgrace,” defended his Ukraine call as “absolutely perfect” and accused Democrats of bringing any legislative progress to a standstill.\\n\\n“They’re frozen, the Democrats,” he said.\\n\\nMaguire\\'s reputation was also on trial Thursday. He has come under fire from Democrats for initially withholding a copy of the complaint from lawmakers. That standoff was technically resolved when the complaint was declassified, and released to the public, in advance of the hearing. But Maguire was still pressed for answers from Democratic committee members on why his office did not hand over the complaint at first.\\n\\nMaguire insisted he is \"not partisan\" and \"not political,\" reminding the panel that he served under eight presidents and has taken the oath of office 11 times.\\n\\n\"I have served and led through turbulent times,\" he said. \"... My integrity has never been questioned until now.\"\\n\\nHowever, he maintained, \"I believe that I handled this matter in full compliance with the law at all times.”\\n\\nAt one point in the hearing, during a tense exchange with Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., about allegations in the complaint of a potential “cover-up” regarding the Ukraine call, Maguire pushed back again by reminding the committee that the complaint was not based on direct knowledge.\\n\\n“This is second-hand information from a whistleblower. I have no knowledge if that is a true and accurate statement,” Maguire said regarding the “cover-up” claim. The complaint said White House officials tried to “lock down” records of the call. In the same document, the whistleblower also acknowledged not being a “direct witness” to most of the events described, instead citing other U.S. officials who are not named.\\n\\nRepublican members also jumped to Maguire\\'s defense at the hearing, while accusing Democrats of launching an \"information warfare operation\" against Trump. Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, said of Maguire: \"I think you\\'re nuts if you\\'re going to convince the American people that your cause is just by attacking this man, by impugning his character.\"\\n\\nSchiff, meanwhile, questioned Maguire over the timeline of his cooperation with the committee. Maguire said he was not able to release the document at first because of executive privilege concerns and other issues. He also said he is not aware of any instance where such a complaint dealt with such \"complicated and sensitive issues.\"\\n\\n\"I believe that this matter is unprecedented,\" he testified. He also said he does not know the identity of the whistleblower, but said he or she acted in \"good faith.\"\\n\\nMaguire maintained that he was \"not stonewalling\" despite the delay in the release of the complaint to the committee, but following \"the law the way it was written, not the law as people might wish it to be.\" Maguire again explained that he was required to review the complaint for executive privilege.\\n\\n\"It took longer than I would have liked,\" he said. \"But once the transcripts were released, no longer was there an issue of executive privilege ... so then I was able to release the information to you.\"\\n\\nHe added: \"At no time did I ever try to withhold information.\"\\n\\nThe complaint cites “multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call\" between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and accuses Trump of attempting “to pressure the Ukranian leader to take actions to help the President’s 2020 reelection bid.” It also presents allegations that the White House tried to \"restrict access\" to records of the call.\\n\\nThe complaint goes on to allege that White House officials said they were \"directed\" by White House attorneys to remove the transcript of the call from the computer system where they are normally kept. Instead, the transcript was allegedly kept on a different system normally used for classified information.\\n\\nWHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT HAS BEEN DECLASSIFIED AND CONTAINS NO \\'SURPRISES,\\' GOP LAWMAKER SAYS\\n\\nMeanwhile, Republicans on the committee, including Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., accused Democrats of orchestrating a public spectacle.\\n\\n\"I want to congratulate the Democrats on the rollout of their latest information warfare operation against the president, and their extraordinary ability once again to enlist the mainstream media in their campaign,\" Nunes said, adding that “we’ve been treated to an unending parade of press releases, press conferences, and fake news stories.”\\n\\n\"The released transcript of the call has already debunked that central assertion, but that didn\\'t matter,\" he continued. \"The Democrats simply moved the goalposts and began claiming that there doesn\\'t need to be a quid pro quo for this conversation to serve as the basis for impeaching the president.\"\\n\\nThe White House, on Wednesday, released an unclassified version of the transcript of that controversial phone call. The memo, which does not reflect a “verbatim transcript” but is based on “notes and recollections” of those memorializing the call, shows Trump congratulating Zelensky on his election victory before Trump eventually gets to the subject of the Bidens, seeking an investigation of some kind.\\n\\nMaguire says that the whistleblower complaint released Thursday \"is in alignment with what was released yesterday by the president.\"\\n\\nTrump first asked Zelensky to do a \"favor\" and “find out what happened” with the hacking of the DNC server in 2016. He referenced CrowdStrike, a cyber firm used by the DNC to investigate the attacks.\\n\\nThen, Trump went on to seek assistance in investigating the Bidens.\\n\\n“The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”\\n\\nThis refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.\\n\\nDEMS DOUBLE DOWN ON IMPEACHMENT AFTER UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT RELEASE\\n\\nWhile the transcript shows Trump pressing Ukraine to “look into” the Bidens, it does not show the U.S. president explicitly linking that request to U.S. aid — which had been frozen days earlier, a detail that fueled impeachment calls earlier this week and helped prompt House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday.\\n\\nHours after the transcript was released, Trump met with Zelensky on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City. Reporters asked Zelensky about the call with Trump, and whether he felt pressured by the U.S. president, as alleged by the whistleblower—an accusation he denied.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n“I think you read everything. I’m sorry but I don’t want to be involved in democratic elections of the USA,” he said. “We had a good phone call. It was normal, we spoke about many things.”\\n\\nHe added: “I think you read it that nobody pushed me.”\\n\\nRepublicans have also raised concerns about the whistleblower\\'s possible \"political bias,\" as the intelligence community inspector general found indications the whistleblower was \"in favor of a rival political candidate\" of Trump.\\n\\nFox News\\' Chad Pergram, Gregg Re, Ed Henry, and Jake Gibson contributed to this report.',\n",

       "  'authors': ['Ronn Blitzer'],\n",
       "  'text': 'The whistleblower complaint that touched off a political tempest in Washington was released to the public Thursday, alleging President Trump used the \"power of his office to solicit interference\" from Ukraine in the 2020 election -- and that White House officials subsequently tried to \"lock down\" records of that phone call.\\n\\nThe rough transcript of the July call, between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, was already released a day earlier by the White House. It confirmed that Trump sought an investigation from Ukraine into the Biden family, though did not show the president explicitly leveraging U.S. aid as had initially been suggested in some media reports.\\n\\nBut the whistleblower complaint, released by the Democrat-led House Intelligence Committee ahead of testimony from Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, goes further, though it is not a first-hand account of the call. The whistleblower, who remains anonymous, says in the complaint that White House officials who heard the call were \"deeply disturbed\" by it, and that White House lawyers discussed how to handle the call \"because of the likelihood, in the officials\\' retelling, that they had witnessed the President abuse his office for personal gain.\"\\n\\nREAD THE COMPLAINT\\n\\nThe document is sure to fuel the impeachment inquiry formally launched by House Democrats earlier this week. Trump, though, has maintained he did nothing wrong.\\n\\n\"THE GREATEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS!\" Trump tweeted Thursday.\\n\\nWhite House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement that, \"Nothing has changed with the release of this complaint.\" She described it as \"nothing more than a collection of third-hand accounts of events and cobbled-together press clippings—all of which shows nothing improper,\" adding Trump \"has nothing to hide.\"\\n\\nThe complaint cites “multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call\" and accuses Trump of attempting “to pressure the Ukranian leader to take actions to help the President’s 2020 reelection bid.” Going beyond the details revealed in the transcript, the complaint then presents allegations that the White House tried to \"restrict access\" to records of the call.\\n\\n\"In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to \\'lock down\\' all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced--as is customary--by the White House Situation Room,\" the complaint says.\\n\\nThe complaint goes on to allege that White House officials said they were \"directed\" by White House attorneys to remove the transcript of the call from the computer system where they are normally kept. Instead, the transcript was allegedly kept on a different system normally used for classified information. The whistleblower says that, according to White House officials, it was \"not the first time\" a presidential transcript was placed into this system in order to protect politically sensitive information and not national security-sensitive information.\\n\\nTRUMP GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE, ALLEGES BIDEN CORRUPTION, SAYS DEMS THREATENED UKRAINE AID MULTIPLE TIMES\\n\\nThe White House released a record of the call Wednesday, confirming a request from Trump for Ukraine to assist Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani in investigating Joe Biden\\'s efforts to have Ukraine\\'s former top prosecutor fired. It also shows, as the complaint alleges, that Trump intended for Attorney General Bill Barr to be involved in this investigation as well.\\n\\nRepublicans maintain that the questions about Biden\\'s intervention are legitimate.\\n\\nBiden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire that prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden had a highly lucrative role on the board paying him tens of thousands of dollars per month, despite limited relevant expertise. Shokin himself had been widely accused of corruption, though. Still, critics charged that Hunter Biden might have been essentially selling access to his father, who had pushed Ukraine to increase its natural gas production.\\n\\nThe complaint cites articles from The Hill, in which Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko alleged that Biden pushed for Shokin\\'s termination to put an end to the Burisma investigation, that other Ukrainian officials had \"interfered\" in the 2016 presidential election by working with the Democratic National Committee, and that the U.S. Embassy in Kiev kept Ukrainian prosecutors from going to the U.S with evidence related to the election. The complaint notes that Lutsenko had expressed a desire to discuss these allegations with Barr.\\n\\nTrump made the request on the July call for Ukraine to look into the Bidens after Zelensky first mentioned Ukraine\\'s corruption issues, and after Trump separately requested as a \"favor\" that Ukraine help investigate foreign interference in the 2016 elections, including the hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server involving the data security company CrowdStrike.\\n\\nWHISTLEBLOWER LAWYERS WORK WITH NONPROFIT TO LAUNCH GOFUNDME PAGE SEEKING $100G AHEAD OF POSSIBLE TESTIMONY\\n\\nThe complaint goes on to say that the day after the call, U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker went to Kiev and met with Zelensky and other Ukrainian figures. The whistleblower says that \"[b]ased on multiple readouts of these meetings recounted to me by various U.S. officials,\" Volker and U.S. European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland gave Zelensky advice \"about how to \\'navigate\\' the demands that the President had made of [Zelensky].\"\\n\\nThe complaint drew criticism from Republicans after it was reported that that whistleblower did not have first-hand knowledge of the call. The Intelligence Community Inspector General’s office also found that the whistleblower showed “some indicia of an arguable political bias” favoring “a rival political candidate.” The IG’s office did, however, determine that the allegation in the complaint “appears credible.”\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nAnother incident described in the complaint is an Aug. 2 meeting in Madrid between Giuliani and a Zelensky adviser, which U.S. officials said was a \"direct follow-up\" to Trump\\'s phone call.\\n\\nThe Justice Department has since examined the call and determined that Trump\\'s requests from Ukraine did not rise to the level of an in-kind contribution to his presidential campaign that warranted further investigation.\\n\\nFox News\\' Gregg Re contributed to this report.',\n",

He is running again in the March primary.\\n\\nCampa-Najjar said Issa joining the field of candidates \"just highlights the fact that Hunter is vulnerable and we\\'re viable, and that Washington insiders are scrambling to find somebody who could effectively challenge our campaign.\"\\n\\nIssa, a former nine-term congressman who made his fortune through a car-alarm company, formed an exploratory committee last month. He retired before the 2018 election from a district divided between San Diego and Orange counties that he narrowly won two years earlier. Democrat Mike Levin won the seat last November.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nIssa\\'s decision comes after his Senate confirmation hearing to be director of the U.S. Trade and Development Agency was delayed indefinitely after Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member Bob Menendez insisted on the release of an FBI background file that sources say shows Issa used a fake ID when he was 17.\\n\\nThe focus on the fake ID he allegedly used as a 17-year-old Army private raised eyebrows, considering Issa had a well-known history of run-ins with the law when he was a teenager involving more serious accusations.\\n\\nBut, during the confirmation hearing, Menendez, D-N.J., argued that the committee did not have access to the information needed to determine whether Issa could be confirmed to his post, and said there was “problematic” information from his FBI background investigation that could be “potentially disqualifying.”\\n\\nFox News’ Brooke Singman and The Associated Press contributed to this report.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Top Republicans on Thursday pushed to identify the White House officials who told a whistleblower of alleged misconduct by the Trump administration, as Democrats ramped up their impeachment inquiry -- and several apparent inconsistencies emerged in the whistleblower\\'s complaint.\\n\\nRepublicans specifically questioned why the whistleblower\\'s sources in the White House didn\\'t file a complaint themselves -- especially given that relevant whistleblower procedures did not protect second-hand complaints until shortly before the whistleblower filed the complaint against Trump. (The New York Times reported that the whistleblower is a CIA officer detailed to the White House. Fox News has not confirmed The Times\\' report.)\\n\\nRep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., a member of the House Judiciary Committee, told Fox News\\' \"Shepard Smith Reporting\" on Thursday that the administration had an apparent \"leak problem,\" adding, \"if they\\'re leaking something that\\'s supposed to be classified, then ... that probably is criminal in nature.\"\\n\\n\"Let\\'s find out,\" Biggs said when Smith asked if he wanted to see the whistleblower\\'s sources.\\n\\nThe whistleblower\\'s complaint, released earlier in the day, contained no firsthand accounts of wrongdoing. It cited information from White House officials who alleged there\\'d been efforts to hide Trump\\'s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, among other conversations. The Trump administration reportedly began placing transcripts of Trump\\'s calls with several foreign leaders in a highly classified repository after leakers publicly divulged the contents of Trump\\'s private calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia in 2017.\\n\\nFLASHBACK: LEAK OF TRUMP CALL WITH AUSTRALIA LEADER PROMPTS WH TO INCREASE SECURITY MEASURES\\n\\nThe complaint stated that Trump made a “specific request that the Ukrainian leader locate and turn over servers used by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and examined by the U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike\" -- a request that does not appear in the declassified transcript of the call released by the Trump administration on Tuesday. Trump mentioned CrowdStrike, but did not demand the server.\\n\\nAnd according to the whistleblower complaint, by mid-May, U.S. diplomat Kurt Volker sought to \"contain the damage\" from Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani\\'s outreach to Ukraine.\\n\\nBut a July 19 text message conversation from Volker to Giuliani, provided to Fox News on Thursday, showed that Volker had in fact encouraged Giuliani to reach out to Ukraine -- even sending Giuliani a message reading, \"connecting you here with Andrey Yermak, who is very close to President Zelensky.\"\\n\\nAdditionally, the complaint said Trump \"suggested that Mr. Zelensky might want to keep\" his current prosecutor general, a claim not supported by the transcript.\\n\\nCBS News reported late Thursday that the whistleblower complaint further inaccurately claimed that a State Department official was on the call with Zelensky.\\n\\nTRUMP GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE, ACCUSES BIDENS OF CORRUPTION, DEMS OF HYPOCRISY\\n\\nThe memo was not a \"verbatim transcript\" but was based on \"notes and recollections\" of those memorializing the call.\\n\\nAs questions arose concerning the whistleblower\\'s identity and credibility, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., echoed Biggs\\' skepticism and called for more information.\\n\\n\"It is imperative we find out which White House official talked to the whistleblower and why. Why didn’t they lodge the complaint?\" he asked on Twitter.\\n\\n\"When I think of whistleblower complaints I generally think of someone with first-hand knowledge of the events in question,\" Graham added.\\n\\nTrump, for his part, reportedly threw his support behind an inquiry into the whistleblower\\'s sources.\\n\\n\"I want to know who\\'s the person, who\\'s the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that’s close to a spy,\" Trump said, according to audio of his remarks at a private event in a New York hotel obtained by The Los Angeles Times. \"You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\"\\n\\nTRUMP ADMIN DECLASSIFIES, RELEASES WHISTLEBLOWER TRANSCRIPT\\n\\nAmong the whistleblower\\'s most explosive accusations was that \"White House officials who heard\" Trump\\'s July call with Zelensky were \"deeply disturbed\" by it, and that White House lawyers discussed how to handle the call \"because of the likelihood, in the officials\\' retelling, that they had witnessed the president abuse his office for personal gain.\"\\n\\nThe complaint cited \"multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call.\"\\n\\nTRUMP GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE, ALLEGES BIDEN CORRUPTION, SAYS DEMS THREATENED UKRAINE AID MULTIPLE TIMES\\n\\nThe complaint went on to raise the specter of a cover-up. It said, \"In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to \\'lock down\\' all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced -- as is customary -- by the White House Situation Room.\"\\n\\nTrump administration officials allegedly said White House attorneys \"directed\" them to remove the transcript of the call from the computer system where they normally were kept, according to the complaint.

The whistleblower said that, according to White House officials, it was \"not the first time\" a presidential transcript was placed into this system in order to protect politically sensitive information and not national security-sensitive information.\\n\\nActing Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, in tense testimony Thursday on Capitol Hill, defended his handling of the whistleblower complaint, while calling the matter \"unprecedented.\"\\n\\nBut after maintaining his composure for most of the morning, his frustration showed through at the end, when House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., repeatedly pressed him to agree that the matter needed to be investigated.\\n\\nREAD THE WHISTLEBLOWER\\'S COMPLAINT\\n\\nREAD THE TRANSCRIPT OF TRUMP\\'S UKRAINE CALL\\n\\nMaguire stressed that the committee had all of the relevant information, including the whistleblower complaint, released publicly Thursday morning, and said it\\'s up to its members to decide how to proceed.\\n\\nMaguire also stressed that the complaint essentially was \"hearsay,\" not \"corroborated by other folks.\"\\n\\nOn Wednesday, the White House released a transcript of Trump\\'s July call with Zelensky, showing Trump sought a review of former Vice President Joe Biden\\'s efforts to have Ukraine\\'s former top prosecutor fired.

       "  'text': 'The Republican-led Senate on Thursday confirmed lawyer Eugene Scalia, a son of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, as President Donald Trump\\'s new labor secretary.\\n\\nThe Senate voted along party lines, 53-44, to approve Scalia\\'s nomination. Republicans said his background in labor and employment law made him qualified for the post. Democrats said Scalia fought for corporations and against workers and was the wrong candidate for the Cabinet post.\\n\\nSen. Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said he received more than 30 letters of support for Scalia from small-business owners, workers, former career lawyers at the Labor Department, where Scalia once worked, and more.\\n\\n\"It is important for the Department of Labor to create an environment to help employers and employees succeed in today\\'s rapidly changing workplace,\" said Alexander, R-Tenn.\\n\\nScalia spent the bulk of his career as a partner in the Washington office of the Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher firm, where he rang up a string of victories in court cases on behalf of business interests challenging labor and financial regulations. He also served for a year as the Labor Department\\'s top lawyer during the George W. Bush administration.\\n\\n\"The president has sent us a corporate lawyer who\\'s fought over and over to stop workplace protections, to undermine worker safety, to depress workers\\' wages over and over and over again,\" said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio.\\n\\nThe AFL-CIO opposed the nomination, calling Scalia a union-busting lawyer who has eroded labor rights and consumer protections.\\n\\n\"We will not forget this betrayal by the Trump administration, and we will never stop fighting to ensure all working people have the safety protections on the job they deserve,\" said AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka.\\n\\nBusiness interests viewed Scalia as a sturdy opponent of government overreach and backed his nomination.\\n\\nFreedomWorks, a conservative group that helped launch the tea party movement, said Scalia\\'s confirmation \"is a victory in the fight against outdated, burdensome workplace regulations that neither protect employees nor encourage job and wage growth.\"\\n\\nScalia becomes the seventh former lobbyist to hold a Cabinet-level post in the Trump administration.\\n\\nOn his financial disclosure form filed with the Office of Government Ethics, Scalia listed 49 clients who paid him $5,000 or more for legal services, including e-cigarette manufacturer Juul Labs, Facebook, Ford, Walmart and Bank of America.\\n\\nDisclosure records show Scalia was registered in 2010 and 2011 to lobby for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\\n\\nTrump\\'s previous labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, resigned in July after renewed criticism for his handling of a 2008 secret plea deal with financier Jeffrey Epstein.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., made a formal request to transmit a whistleblower complaint concerning the president\\'s Ukraine call to the committee. To date, $225 million has been allocated, according to defense officials.\\n\\nTrump has repeatedly said his July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was \"perfect.\" Trump has also denied withholding the aid to motivate Ukrainian officials to investigate potential 2020 election rival Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and their business activity in Ukraine.\\n\\nUKRAINE PRESIDENT, IN MEETING WITH TRUMP, SAYS \\'NOBODY PUSHED ME\\' TO PROBE BIDEN\\n\\nZelensky said Wednesday that Trump had not pressured him during their phone call over the summer.\\n\\n\"Nobody pushed me,\" he said at a bilateral meeting with Trump at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City. “We had a great phone call. It was normal.”\\n\\nThe transcript of the call was released Thursday. It shows the president sought an investigation from Ukraine into the Biden family, though it does not show Trump explicitly leveraging U.S. aid as had initially been suggested.\\n\\nTrump returned to Joint Base Andrews on Thursday and called the allegations, which have spurred a House impeachment inquiry, \"another witch hunt.\"\\n\\nHe tweeted earlier about the call, saying it was a \"very nice, no pressure call.\"\\n\\n\"Here we go again. It\\'s Adam Schiff and his crew making up stories,\" Trump told reporters, noting: \"It\\'s a terrible thing for our country.\"\\n\\n\"It was an absolutely perfect phone call to the new president of Ukraine,\" he added.\\n\\nWHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT ON UKRAINE CALL RELEASED, ALLEGES TRUMP SOLICITED FOREIGN \\'INTERFERENCE\\' IN ELECTION\\n\\nOn June 18, the Defense Department announced $250 million in aid to Ukraine. On July 25, Trump had the now-controversial call with Zelensky.\\n\\nA month later, on Aug. 26, the whistleblower complaint was forwarded to Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.\\n\\nSchiff subpoenaed Maguire on Sept. 13, claiming the acting director was unlawfully withholding a whistleblower complaint from Congress, possibly to protect the president or top administration officials. Maguire testified publicly before the committee on Thursday.\\n\\nUKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP\\'S CALL WITH ZELENSKY: \\'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE\\'\\n\\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper tweeted on Sept. 18 that he had a \"productive call\" with Ukraine\\'s defense minister.\\n\\n\"I am optimistic about his vision for MoD [the Ministry of Defense] and commitment to defense and anti-corruption reforms. I expressed unwavering U.S. support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" Esper said.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., asked the Pentagon Office of the Inspector General to investigate the Defense Department\\'s potential role in withholding $250 million in military aid to Ukraine.\\n\\n\"I’m calling on the DoD OIG to investigate the withholding of Ukraine military aid appropriated by Congress, allegedly at the direction of the White House.\"\\n\\n\"The delay raises questions about whether DoD officials were involved in any scheme to target a political opponent,\" he tweeted.\\n\\nFox News\\' Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report.',\n",

       "  'authors': ['Adam Shaw'],\n",
       "  'text': 'Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Matthew Albence on Thursday revealed a recent ICE operation nabbed dozens of illegal immigrants with a record of child sex offenses, as he railed against the dangers of \"sanctuary cities\" he said put public safety at risk.\\n\\n“It’s time to publicly call out those who have put politics over public safety, those who make our communities less secure, who create safe havens in which criminal aliens and gangs are allowed to flourish and can victimize innocent people with impunity,” he said in a White House briefing, surrounded by sheriffs and other law enforcement officials.\\n\\nHUNGARY JOINS TRUMP\\'S ATTACK ON \\'OPEN-BORDERS\\' AGENDA AT UN, SAYS \\'NATIONAL INTEREST COMES FIRST\\'\\n\\nThe briefing was part of a coordinated push by the Trump administration to again highlight the dangers of “sanctuary” jurisdictions that refuse to comply with detainers from immigration enforcement authorities. Senior ICE officials will be holding briefings across the country to warn of the dangers of sanctuary policies.\\n\\nThose detainers request that local law enforcement notify immigration authorities when an illegal immigrant who has been arrested is due to be released from jail, so that they can be picked up by ICE and placed in deportation proceedings. Albence said that last year they deported more than 145,000 criminal illegal immigrants, including 10,000 gang members, and that about 70 percent of arrests ICE conducts occur via a detainer from a local or state jail or prison.\\n\\nBut with anti-ICE and open-border sentiments taking a growing hold among Democratic lawmakers and left-wing activists, a number of cities and states -- including New Jersey, California, Chicago and New York City -- have implemented sanctuary policies and refused to cooperate with law enforcement.\\n\\nAlbence pointed to a national ICE operation this week in which officers made 1,300 arrests. He said that of those, officers arrested nearly 200 who could have been arrested in jail if detainers had been honored.\\n\\nCBP CHIEF RIPS INTO \\'RECKLESS\\' LAWMAKERS FOR ATTACKS ON BORDER AGENTS, WARNS IT\\'S HURTING MORALE\\n\\nOf those arrested, three had convictions for murder or manslaughter and 100 had convictions for sexual crimes -- with nearly half of those crimes involving children. Meanwhile, 70 had convictions for drug crimes and 328 had convictions for driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol.\\n\\nAlbence gave the example of a man in Mecklenburg County, N.C., who was arrested for driving while intoxicated earlier this year. ICE filed a detainer but he was released. In June he was then arrested for two counts of assault on a female, assault by strangulation, assault with a deadly weapon and a DWI. He was again released, despite an ICE detainer.\\n\\n\"Hopefully we will find him before he hurts or kills another innocent victim,” he said.\\n\\nHe added that ICE could prevent numerous crimes if local law enforcement complied with detainers, and asked what those jurisdictions to say to the family of a victim of a crime committed by an illegal immigrant.\\n\\n“For those who support victims’ rights, and who among us doesn’t, how do we tell a grieving victim that the person who hurt you or your loved one that the crime was preventable if local law enforcement had merely honored a detainer or given us a phone call?” he said. “Who are these sanctuary cities really protecting?”\\n\\nLaw enforcement who joined Albence at the podium echoed those sentiments.\\n\\n“We know that too often in the wake of these criminal aliens are left nothing but a trail of victims,” said Sheriff Jim Skinner of Collin County, Texas.\\n\\nAlbence’s questioning of whether liberal immigration policies are as compassionate as activists claim comes on the heels of Trump making a similar argument at the United Nations, where he slammed the “cruel” policies of open-border activists.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n\"Today, I have a message for those open border activists who cloak themselves in the rhetoric of social justice: Your policies are not just, your policies are cruel and evil,\" he said Tuesday, accusing them of promoting human smuggling and the \"erasure of national borders.\"\\n\\n“You are empowering criminal organizations that prey on innocent men, women and children. You put your own false sense of virtue before the lives and well-being of countless innocent people,” he said. \"When you undermine border security, you are undermining human rights and human dignity.\"',\n",

       "  'text': '(CNN) The highly anticipated whistleblower report regarding President Donald Trump and his conversations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shook Washington on Thursday as the public rushed to read the nine-page document. But some of the most influential people on Capitol Hill -- Senate Republicans -- didn\\'t have much to say in the hours after it came out.\\n\\nMany Senate Republicans said on Thursday that they haven\\'t read the whistleblower complaint yet. Others said the complaint doesn\\'t change things and raises \"more questions than answers.\"\\n\\nHere\\'s what they told reporters about the complaint:\\n\\nOklahoma Sen. James Lankford and North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven each said they were in appropriations mark-ups and hadn\\'t yet read the full complaint.\\n\\nIndiana Sen. Mike Braun said he hadn\\'t read it either, adding that he didn\\'t know about the allegations to \"lock down\" information at the White House. Braun went on to say that he didn\\'t feel the complaint would change Republicans\\' views of impeachment, and said the Democrats had made a mistake starting an impeachment inquiry before knowing more about the complaint.\\n\\nTennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander said he has not read the complaint. \"I\\'m waiting for the intelligence committee to finish its work.\"\\n\\nOhio Sen. Rob Portman said he said he\\'s been \"running around\" all day and hasn\\'t read it and would not comment.\\n\\nArkansas Sen. Tom Cotton said \"no comment\" twice and boarded a senators-only elevator when asked if he was concerned the White House was locking down information.\\n\\nMissouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said, \"We\\'re committed to gather the information before we reach conclusions. Other people who don\\'t have this responsibility can reach conclusions right away,\" Blunt said. \"In my case I\\'m not ready to make any conclusions yet and still ready to gather more information.\"\\n\\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio told reporters he has read the whistleblower\\'s complaint, and says he has \"more questions than answers.\"\\n\\nIdaho Sen. Jim Risch, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that there was \"nothing there\" when asked about the rough transcript of Trump\\'s call with the Ukrainian leader. On the whistleblower complaint, he said that he prefers to look at the primary document, meaning the rough transcript.\\n\\nSouth Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds said \"they are using second-hand information right now. Let\\'s let the committee investigate it.\"\\n\\nIowa Sen. Joni Ernst said she hasn\\'t had time to read the whole complaint, saying, \"I am going to have to dig into it.\"\\n\\nSen. Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said after his panel heard testimony from acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire that \"this will generate more questions than we asked today. The next two weeks we\\'ll probably be trying to get answers to those,\" referencing the two-week Senate recess that began Thursday. \"Don\\'t expect us to move at lightspeed -- that will probably happen in the House. But the committee is committed to make sure we get to the bottom of questions (that) need answers.\"\\n\\nSen. Susan Collins, of Maine, said the hearing was a \"worthwhile discussion\" and \"there are obviously a lot of questions\" coming out of it.\\n\\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina raised doubts Friday about the intelligence community whistleblower\\'s complaint because it includes \"hearsay\" that \"brings everything into question.\" \"First, I would suggest that since it\\'s a whistleblower who was not really there, it\\'s not really a whistleblower. So, it\\'s really more hearsay,\" Scott said.\\n\\nSen. John Cornyn of Texas defended Trump as well, questioning the whistleblower. \"How can you be a whistleblower if you are merely relying what other, unnamed people are telling you, i.e., no personal knowledge?\" Cornyn tweeted.\\n\\nThis story will be updated with more reactions as they become available.',\n",

       "  'authors': ['Analysis Chris Cillizza', 'Cnn Editor-At-Large'],\n",
       "  'text': '(CNN) It\\'s always a challenge to understand why Donald Trump says and does things. He is a hugely impulsive figure who often acts on a whim. There is no long-term strategy that informs his daily tactical decisions -- just Trump, well, doing stuff.\\n\\nBut even by that haphazard standard, the President\\'s decision this week to release a rough transcript of his July 25 conversation with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky makes zero political sense -- either in the moment he did it or in the after-action report.\\n\\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\\n\\nThe rough log of the call makes quite clear to any fair-minded person that Trump did the following things:\\n\\n1) Repeatedly reminded Zelensky of how much the United States does (and can do) for Ukraine.\\n\\n2) Asked Zelensky to investigate debunked allegations of corrupt activity by Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in Ukraine\\n\\n3) Said he would put Attorney General William Barr and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani in touch with Zelensky to follow up about the Biden probe.\\n\\nThat\\'s not an interpretation of what Trump said or a second-hand account of the call. It is an, admittedly rough, transcript released (and presumably blessed) by the White House. In which the President of the United States says things like \"I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time\" and \"Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me.\" (There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.)\\n\\nThat we have the President\\'s actual words here -- undisputed -- makes this whole matter so, so much worse for Trump.\\n\\nRemember that in the Mueller probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and Trump\\'s possible role in obstructing that investigation, we never had a transcript of, say, the conversation between the President and then-FBI Director James Comey in which Comey alleges Trump asked him to drop the investigation into Michael Flynn. Or of Trump\\'s conversation with Corey Lewandowski, in which the President told his former campaign manager to tell Attorney General Jeff Sessions to un-recuse himself in the probe.\\n\\nWe also don\\'t have a transcript of Trump referring to Haiti and African nations as \"[s-hole] countries.\" Or of the full conversations between Trump and his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, as they discussed the hush money payments made to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. Or lots and lots of other controversies and alleged conversations -- big and small -- that have sprouted up during Trump\\'s first three years in office.\\n\\nThat\\'s not this. In this case, we have the receipts -- even if what was released by the White House was not a full transcript but rather a sort of rough memo documenting the conversation between Trump and Zelensky. It\\'s a primary source document that, uh, documents a clear use of pressure by Trump to get Zelensky to do what he wants.\\n\\nAs he often does, Trump has doubled/tripled/quadrupled down on his initial mistake.\\n\\n\"\\'IT WAS A PERFECT CONVERSATION WITH UKRAINE PRESIDENT!\\'\" Trump tweeted Friday morning -- apparently quoting himself and in ALL CAPS, no less! Later on Friday, he added : \"If that perfect phone call with the President of Ukraine Isn\\'t considered appropriate, then no future President can EVER again speak to another foreign leader!\"\\n\\nThe number of tweets -- and the amount of defensiveness contained therein -- would suggest to even the most armchair of psychologists that the President might well be overcompensating for something he now realizes he very, very much should not have done.\\n\\nWhether Trump\\'s decision to release the transcript was driven by his blindness to how it would read or his conviction that he did everything absolutely perfectly -- or both -- is sort of beside the point now. The genie is out of the bottle. And that reality is incredibly perilous for the President.',\n",

       "  'authors': ['Tara Subramaniam'],\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington (CNN) Speaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House Thursday, President Donald Trump widened his requests for foreign leaders to investigate his political opponent, repeating accusations about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter\\'s involvement with Ukraine and China.\\n\\nSpecifically, Trump said that, \"China should start an investigation into the Bidens,\" alleging that they received a \"payoff\" worth billions. Trump said that while he hasn\\'t yet asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to look into the Bidens, he will start \"thinking about it.\"\\n\\nOn Thursday, CNN reported that in a June call with Xi, Trump raised Biden\\'s political prospects as well as those of Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\\n\\nIn attacking the Bidens over the past few weeks, Trump has spent the majority of his time focusing on Ukraine , but he\\'s also at times made vague allegations about the Bidens\\' ties to China. On several occasions, he has intimated that the Bidens have received millions of dollars from China, implying they capitalized on the then vice president\\'s political power and connections.\\n\\nWe\\'ve already fact-checked the President\\'s claims about the Bidens and Ukraine. Trump\\'s latest allegations involving China are similarly misleading.\\n\\nFacts First: There is no evidence that former Vice President Joe Biden received money from China. Though when it comes to Biden\\'s son Hunter, Trump\\'s allegations are not thoroughly unfounded.\\n\\nHere\\'s what Trump has said:\\n\\nDuring his remarks at the United Nations on September 25 with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump said, \"When Biden\\'s son walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund, and the biggest funds in the world can\\'t get money out of China, and he\\'s there for one quick meeting and he flies in on Air Force Two, I think that\\'s a horrible thing. I think it\\'s a horrible thing.\" Details on the deal that the President cited come from conservative author Peter Schweizer\\'s newest book \"Secret Empires.\"\\n\\nA day later, in an exchange with reporters on September 26, Trump implicated the elder Biden in his allegations, saying, \"But Adam Schiff doesn\\'t talk about Joe Biden and his son walking away with millions of dollars from Ukraine and then millions of dollars from China. Walking away, in a quick meeting, walking away with millions of dollars.\"\\n\\nHere\\'s what we know:\\n\\nA company, whose board Hunter Biden sat on, received a large investment of Chinese capital shortly after Hunter Biden visited the country with his father.\\n\\nAccording to the New York Times , Biden\\'s son Hunter has a 10% interest in BHR Partners, a private-equity fund that the Chinese government-owned Bank of China has invested in. As of May 2019, both The New York Times and the Washington Post reported that Hunter had not received any money from the fund or in connection with his role as an unpaid advisory board member.\\n\\nIn July 2019, more than two years after his father left office, Hunter purchased an equity stake in the BHR fund, valued around $430,000, according to the Washington Post\\n\\nAfter Trump\\'s meeting with Zelensky at the United Nations, one of Hunter\\'s lawyers told the Washington Post that, \"To date, Mr. Biden has not received any return or compensation on account of this investment or his position on the board of directors.\"\\n\\nThe characterization of Mr. Biden as owning a $1.5 billion private equity firm funded by the Chinese, or suggesting that Mr. Biden has earned millions of dollars from the firm is a gross misrepresentation of Mr. Biden\\'s role with BHR.\"\\n\\nIn December 2013, the same month the fund was officially established , Hunter joined his father and one of his daughters on a trip to China. There, Hunter met up with Jonathan Li, the fund\\'s China-based partner. The New Yorker reported that Li met Hunter at his hotel and shook hands with the vice president. Days after the start of the trip, Hunter had officially joined BHR\\'s board, the Washington Post reports , raising questions about whether he had used his father\\'s access for his own personal benefit.\\n\\nHowever, according to The New Yorker, Hunter maintains that visit with Li was social, not business-related.\\n\\nSchweizer, who also wrote \"Clinton Cash,\" suggested in a May op-ed for the New York Post that the vice president was responsible for or helped influence what he claimed in \"Secret Empires\" was a $1.5 billion deal the fund made with the Bank of China, which was signed shortly after the Bidens\\' trip to China.\\n\\nWhile Schweizer points to that handshake between Biden and Li as evidence that Hunter profited from his father\\'s position, technically that\\'s untrue as Hunter did not personally make any money until years after his father was no longer serving as vice president.\\n\\nThis story has been updated following Trump\\'s October 3 comments.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The White House and congressional Democrats moved into a state of total political war in the wake of this week\\'s stunning document dumps, historic testimony and impeachment inquiry launch over President Trump\\'s July phone call with the Ukrainian president.\\n\\nWith the transcript of that call and the related whistleblower complaint now public -- and the acting director of national intelligence giving his account to a House committee Thursday -- the battle between these two branches of government is truly joined. And neither side is giving an inch.\\n\\nTRUMP DEMANDS SCHIFF RESIGN OVER \\'PARODY\\' READING OF UKRAINE CALL\\n\\nTrump and his allies are now ramping up their attacks on Democrats, the media, the whistleblower and the various sources who fed information on the president that made its way into the complaint. House Democrats, meanwhile, are moving full speed ahead with the formal impeachment inquiry announced earlier this week, with reports indicating lawmakers plan to move quickly with their investigation -- raising the possibility of articles of impeachment before year\\'s end.\\n\\n\"The presidential oath of office requires the President of the United States to do two things: Faithfully execute his or her office, and protect and defend the Constitution. The whistleblower complaint and call record provide the most graphic evidence yet Trump has done neither,\" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff tweeted.\\n\\nAll this has played out in a matter of days, with the Ukraine controversy spurring Democratic leadership into impeachment action in a way the Russia controversy did not. The White House, for its part, spent most of the week trying to clear the air. It released a transcript of the call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy showing Trump urging his Kiev counterpart to \"look into\" former Vice President Joe Biden and his son—a move Democrats claim was Trump seeking assistance from a foreign power in the 2020 presidential election. The now-released whistleblower complaint on the same call included additional allegations, including claims that officials tried to hide records of the call.\\n\\nBut the president and his legal team are fighting back by likening the whistleblower and his or her sources to spies -- and questioning whether this is all the work of partisans.\\n\\n\"Sounding more and more like the so-called Whistleblower isn’t a Whistleblower at all. In addition, all second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else, a leaker or spy, feeding it to him or her? A partisan operative?\" Trump tweeted Friday.\\n\\nHe also blasted media coverage, including the New York Times\\' Peter Baker for his latest reporting on the call.\\n\\nAnd he demanded the resignation of Schiff, D-Calif., for \"fraudulently\" reading out a hyperbolic account of his phone call with the Ukrainian president during a hearing on Thursday.\\n\\nTrump began raising questions about the whistleblower on Thursday.\\n\\n“I want to know who’s the person, who’s the person who gave the whistleblower the information?” Trump said, according to audio of his remarks at a private event in a New York hotel obtained by the Los Angeles Times. “Because that’s close to a spy.”\\n\\nHe added: “You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.”\\n\\nTrump’s lawyer Jay Sekulow suggested Friday the whistleblower had assistance in writing the complaint that rocked Washington.\\n\\n“Do you think the whistleblower drafted the complaint? I mean realistically?” Sekulow said on “Fox & Friends.” “Look at the phraseology, the endnotes, and the footnotes—this wasn’t drafted by this individual. This was written by a law firm. The American people see it as it is. Nobody has an appetite for this anymore.”\\n\\nSekulow blasted the fallout surrounding the controversy as “political theater.”\\n\\n“There is no there, there,” he said. “There was no violation of law, rule or regulation.”\\n\\nREPUBLICANS WANT WHISTLEBLOWER\\'S SOURCES, AS INCONSISTENCIES IN COMPLAINT EMERGE\\n\\nOn Thursday, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified publicly before the House Intelligence Committee. Despite being pressed for hours by Democrats, Maguire maintained that the whistleblower complaint was “hearsay” and “second-hand” information—a sentiment Sekulow echoed Friday.\\n\\nSekulow also responded to allegations the White House moved call records from a computer system where they are normally kept to a system normally used for classified information.\\n\\n“A cover-up? Think about that for a moment. The White House secured a call with the president of Ukraine? It’s so secret, and such a cover-up, here’s the documents,” Sekulow said. “This is nonsense.”\\n\\nThe transcript itself showed Trump pressing Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Biden\\'s son Hunter had a highly lucrative role on the board. Biden supporters say Shokin was widely accused of corruption.\\n\\nWhile the transcript shows Trump pressing Ukraine to “look into” the Bidens, it does not show the U.S. president explicitly linking that request to U.S. aid — which had been frozen days earlier, a detail that fueled impeachment calls earlier this week and helped prompt House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday.\\n\\nTrump allies, like Sekulow, and others in the White House, have used that distinction to maintain the claim that “there was no quid pro quo.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, the whistleblower also alleged that Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, whom the president mentioned on the call could help Zelensky in any anti-corruption probes, was improperly involved in soliciting foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election.\\n\\nGiuliani, though, defended his involvement, telling Fox News’ Laura Ingraham, “I think I should get some kind of an award.”\\n\\n“What they charged as Russian collusion was really Ukrainian collusion,” Giuliani said on “The Ingraham Angle” Thursday night. “I am doing an effective job of showing what phonies they are and I am uncovering what you will find to be an enormous pay for play scheme.”\\n\\nGiuliani also told the Atlantic on Thursday that he thinks he deserves praise for his involvement with Ukraine.\\n\\n“It is impossible that the whistle-blower is a hero and I’m not,” he told the Atlantic. “And I will be the hero! These morons—when this is over, I will be the hero.”\\n\\nBut Democrats are using all of the developments as fodder as they hit the gas pedal in their impeachment proceedings. Pelosi said Friday that she did not have an exact timetable for impeachment, though noted that it could “take time.”\\n\\nPelosi also noted that the House committees involved in the process are going to probe the “cover-up” allegations while saying that Trump’s comments about the whistleblower have been “dangerous.”\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n“For the president to say what he said about those who may have supplied information to the whistleblower seriously undermines integrity in government,” Pelosi said Friday. “But the president does that almost every day.”\\n\\nThe House and Senate are on recess for the next two weeks, but members plan to use this period to speak to constituents and garner support for the process.\\n\\n“Congress ought to be talking to their constituents and gaining their perspective on that and why they think this is such an important facet of this ongoing investigation,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said. “I think consideration of the public’s viewpoint is critically important.”\\n\\nAnd freshman pro-impeachment Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., said members need to “go home and educate them.”\\n\\nFox News’ Adam Shaw, Chad Pergram, and Matthew Reidy contributed to this report.',\n",

       "  'text': \"The Justice Department first learned about the controversial call between President Trump and the Ukrainian president in mid-August after being informed by a top CIA official of internal concerns, Fox News has confirmed.\\n\\nDuring a “regularly scheduled” and “routine” phone call on Aug. 14, CIA General Counsel Courtney Simmons Elwood notified John Demers, the top official in the Justice Department’s National Security Division, of the issue, a source familiar with the sequence of events told Fox News.\\n\\nTRUMP, ALLIES RAMP UP ATTACKS OVER UKRAINE CALL FUROR AS DEMS HIT GAS ON IMPEACHMENT\\n\\nAccording to the source, Demers contacted Elwood the next day for more information and then went to the White House to read the transcribed notes from Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Demers then shared the information with other top Justice Department officials and discussed next steps.\\n\\nAccording to the source, Attorney General Bill Barr was not involved in the conversations or informed on the matter at that point. It is unclear when Barr was briefed on the matter, but at least one senior Justice Department official was made aware of the call and concerns surrounding it that day.\\n\\n\\n\\nFox News has learned that during the weekly call between Demers and Elwood on Aug.14th, there were also other officials on the call, including at least one White House official. At the end of the call Elwood brought up a potential issue she had heard about a White House phone call. The White House official on the call mentioned that there was a transcript of the call and that is how Demers ultimately ended up at the White House the next day to review the transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following week, beginning on Aug.19th, there was confusion among Demers and other officials at the Department of Justice because the CIA had made them aware of the phone call and a potential complaint, but the CIA had not made an actual referral to the DOJ, leaving the Department without a clear path, according to a person familiar with the sequence of events.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe situation was ultimately resolved on Aug. 26th when the DOJ received the complaint from the Director of National Intelligence and the intelligence community inspector general.\\n\\nThe official whistleblower complaint regarding that call had already been transmitted to the intelligence community inspector general at that point. The IG has reported receiving that information on Aug. 12.\\n\\nBut the DOJ apparently learned of the concerns days before the complaint was formally turned over by the IG. The inspector general relayed the complaint to Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire on Aug. 26, who then referred the matter to the Justice Department for review of executive privilege in the contents of the phone call.\\n\\nMaguire testified on his handling of the matter on Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee, defending his actions and citing the “unprecedented” nature of the matter.\\n\\nThe timeline of when the Justice Department first learned of the call was first reported by CNN on Thursday. The names of the officials involved in those initial discussions were not known until now.\\n\\nThe phone call is now at the heart of Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry into the president, announced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi this week.\\n\\nINTEL CHIEF DEFENDS HANDLING OF TRUMP CALL COMPLAINT, SPARS WITH SCHIFF IN TENSE HEARING\\n\\nThe White House released an unclassified version of the transcript of the phone call on Wednesday. The memo, which does not reflect a “verbatim transcript” but is based on notes and recollections of those memorializing the call, shows Trump congratulating Zelensky on his election victory before Trump eventually gets to the subject of the Bidens, seeking an investigation of some kind.\\n\\nTrump first asked Zelensky to do a “favor” and “find out what happened” with the hacking of the Democratic National Committee server in 2016. He referenced CrowdStrike, a cyber firm used by the DNC to investigate the attacks.\\n\\nThen, Trump went on to seek assistance in investigating the Bidens.\\n\\n“The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that [Joe] Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”\\n\\nThis refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokrin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden allies maintain that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.\\n\\nThe whistleblower’s complaint, which was declassified by the Trump administration and released by the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday, alleged that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens, and claimed that Trump was soliciting foreign assistance to intervene in the 2020 presidential election. The whistleblower acknowledged in the complaint, though, that this was based on second-hand information.\\n\\nWhile the transcript shows Trump pressing Ukraine to “look into” the Bidens, Trump allies note that it does not show the U.S. president explicitly linking that request to U.S. aid—which had been frozen days earlier. Biden is vying for the Democratic presidential nomination.\\n\\nOn the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City on Wednesday, Trump met with Zelensky, who was asked by reporters about whether he felt pressured by Trump on the phone call this summer.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n“I think you read everything. I’m sorry but I don’t want to be involved in democratic elections of the U.S.A.,” Zelensky said. “We had a good phone call. It was normal, we spoke about many things.”\\n\\nHe added: “Nobody pushed me.”\",\n",

He says he’ll pay for the program by implementing a national value-added tax.\\n\\nSpeaking Friday morning at a local chamber of commerce event in New Hampshire, the state that holds the first presidential primary, Yang was asked by an audience member how a potential economic crisis or recession would impact his presidential campaign.\\n\\nYang answered: “I think that if we do have a downturn over this next period, it would likely be good for my campaign because I’m so focused on this set of issues, and I think it would actually increase the appeal and appetite for some of the measures I\\'m describing.\"\\n\\nBut a few minutes later the candidate told Fox News and the New Hampshire-based Seacoast Media Group that he’s not rooting for the economy to go south.\\n\\n“When I was asked a question how would it affect my campaign, I think most people would agree that if there is a downturn, the party in power or in office generally has a harder time getting reelected. But I would never wish for that,” he said.\\n\\nPresident Trump in recent months has repeatedly dismissed fears of an impending recession, and he and some other Republicans have accused Democrats and the mainstream media of rooting for an economic downturn.\\n\\nYANG WANTS TO OVERHAUL WHITE HOUSE MOTORCADE WITH ELECTRIC CARS\\n\\nDemocratic presidential candidates have mostly avoided any appearance of cheering for a recession, which of course could harm the finances of the very voters they’re courting.\\n\\nYang, in answering the question about a potential economic downturn, pointed to the government’s efforts last decade to rebound from last decade’s great recession “where we prioritized the banks” and the recent Trump tax cuts “where we prioritized” big corporations.\\n\\nThe candidate highlighted that “when I’m president, we’ll look around and say let’s actually strengthen our communities and our common folks directly and that’s going to be a way for us to get through whatever economic tensions are coming our way.”',\n",

       "  'authors': ['Morgan Phillips'],\n",
       "  'text': 'The Senate Thursday confirmed the nomination of Air Force General John Hyten to become the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the second-highest-ranking military officer in the U.S., after months of delays for an investigation into sexual misconduct claims.\\n\\nHyten\\'s former aide, Army Col. Kathryn Spletstoser, accused the general of assaulting her in a California hotel room in 2017. She said Hyten kissed, hugged and rubbed up against her while she pushed him away and told him to stop, and that he tried to derail her military career after she rebuffed him.\\n\\nThe Senate confirmed Hyten by a 75-22 vote, indicating a bit more opposition than most military nominations, which often get near-unanimous Senate support. The only Republican to vote \"no\" was Joni Ernst of Iowa, a survivor of sexual assault while in college and former reserve officer.\\n\\n\"It has been a painful time for me and my family, but I want to state to you and the American people in the strongest possible terms that these allegations are false,\" Hyten said during a committee hearing in July. \"Nothing happened, ever.\"\\n\\nA separate Air Force investigation found no evidence to support the accusations. Officials told Fox News Spletstoser had leveled various accusations against at least a dozen other military officers in recent years, none of which were substantiated. Spletstoser has said she never made any sexual assault allegations against anyone else.\\n\\nSpletstoser said she believes Hyten\\'s confirmation proves the military is still unequipped to handle sexual assault cases. \"The process for seeking justice has been a sham; I have not had the opportunity to tell my story publicly and have been subject to a rushed and incomplete inquiry overseen by an officer junior in rank to General Hyten. I received a military protective order - the equivalent of a civilian restraining order - against General Hyten in May after he exhibited threatening behavior, including stalking,\" she said in a statement.\\n\\nOfficials said Spletstoser had been fired from her job under Hyten’s command running the U.S. military’s nuclear arsenal a few months after the alleged incident occurred for creating a “toxic” work environment and “bullying” subordinates while displaying a “volcanic temper.”\\n\\nPOMPEO ACCUSES SYRIA OF USING CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN MAY ATTACK\\n\\nIt was Spletstoser’s behavior under Hyten that led Ernst to question Hyten’s nomination during the hearings.\\n\\n“There are professional responsibilities associated with being such a high ranking leader and that is to make sure that those within your command are following your directive and not engaging in toxic leadership,\" she said. \"So this leaves me with concerns about your judgment and ability to lead in one of the highest positions in the U.S. military.\"\\n\\nHowever, another Colonel who served under Spletstoser\\'s command in Korea from 2011-2013 spoke highly of her moral character. \"Kathy was an awesome commander and an officer that you could depend on in good or bad times,\" said Col. Loi M. Nguyen. \"If she were to lead us into combat in the future, I would be happy to serve with her because of her competency, candidness, and high moral character,\" he added.\\n\\nOthers voting \"no\" Thursday included two Democratic presidential candidates Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who has made military sexual misconduct one of her top issues in the Senate; and Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, an Iraq War veteran who lost her legs when her helicopter was shot down.\\n\\nBut Hyten received support from Sen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., a former fighter pilot who has publicly described her own sexual assault that she says occurred while she was in the military.\\n\\nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES CUTTING REFUGEE LIMIT TO LOWEST LEVEL IN PROGRAM\\'S HISTORY\\n\\n\"To be clear, this wasn’t just a jump ball. Not a he-said, she-said,\" McSally told the Senate Armed Services Committee in July. \"Not a situation where we just couldn’t prove what allegedly happened. I believe the truth still matters in our country. And the full truth was revealed in this process.\\n\\nThe truth is that General Hyten is innocent of these charges,\" McSally went on. \"Sexual assault happens in the military. It just didn’t happen in this case.\\n\\n\"Today\\'s Senate confirmation of Gen John Hyten to be the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is good news for our military and good news for our nation,\" said Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David F. Goldfein. \"John Hyten is the leader, strategist, and above all an individual with the character and values to lead our men and women in uniform well.\"\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nMarine Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, congratulated Hyten, calling him a “visionary leader with an unparalleled strategic perspective.” Dunford is retiring next Monday after four years on the job, so Hyten will be serving under Army Gen. Mark Milley.\\n\\nHyten has served in the Air Force for nearly four decades and most recently headed U.S. Strategic Command, which controls America\\'s nuclear force. He also led Air Force Space Command and served as mission director at Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado, the military\\'s iconic defense bunker during the Cold War.\\n\\nThe Associated Press and Lucas Tomlinson contributed to this report.',\n",

Now he’s on a bus in Iowa trying to win over voters and distinguish himself in a crowded field of Democrats running for president.\\n\\n“I think of a lot of them think it’s funny that someone they know is running for president,” Buttigieg said of those he served with in Afghanistan. “They’ve been encouraging.\"\\n\\nHe added: \"I mean a lot of them are more politically conservative than I am, but they are supportive.”\\n\\nButtigieg decided to take a page from former Republican presidential candidate John McCain’s playbook by emulating the Arizona senator\\'s famous “Straight Talk Express” bus tours -- in which he traveled with members of the media and opened himself up to questions on any topic.\\n\\nIt was Buttigieg’s first cup of coffee Sunday morning when he began comparing politics to football.\\n\\n“I think football provides the most analogies for politics, he said. \"You’re protecting the quarterback but it’s not all about the quarterback -- because if you forget the importance of the line ,you’re in trouble.\"\\n\\nThe campaign and reporters traveled to nine cities in four days on the Premiere Transportation coach that former President Barack Obama, legendary director Steven Spielberg, Sen. Mitt Romney, and entertainers Steve Harvey and Justin Timberlake have used. President Trump also rode on the bus at one point, according to Premiere Transportation staff.\\n\\nIt wasn’t typical bus seating.\\n\\nThe furniture allowed Buttigieg to look reporters in the eye. The bus was equipped with Wi-Fi for the press to file stories, and a flat-screen television, which allowed Buttigieg to keep an eye on football and the news. Also installed: a counter full of snacks, including chocolate chip cookies, protein bars, chips, gummy bears and coffee.\\n\\n“I like sliced pickles, but other than that, my snack choices are pretty basic. I like beef jerky,” he said.\\n\\nWhen he wasn\\'t talking to reporters, Buttigieg was trying to make contact with Iowa voters.\\n\\n“I looked at all the presidential [candidates] and I put a chart out,\" Amani Latimer, a Wisconsin voter and founder of Mamas 4 Pete, said after Buttigieg’s meet-and-greet in Dubuque. “I was, like, all over analytics, and I said this guy gets it.”\\n\\n“I think he would make a great president, I mean he so’s smart,” Iowa caucusgoer Lindra Bicksler said after a campaign rally in Clinton. “He speaks seven languages and would be able to talk to leaders of other countries himself.”\\n\\nWhile the yellow and blue bus rolled through rural Iowa, Buttigieg took a moment from talking with reporters to pull out his phone and look at the latest polls from The Des Moines Register and CNN. They put him fourth behind Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\\n\\n“Oh, it’s a four-way race,” Buttigieg said.\\n\\nButtigieg said the bus tour is just one part of his strategy of connecting with voters in smaller communities, who he says are key to the Dem nomination.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n“I’m not too worried about a variation like that, especially in a moment when only one in five people say they’ve made up their mind,” he said. “I think the important thing is that people know you, know what you’re about, do they like what they see -- and we’re seeing a lot of encouragement on that front.”\\n\\nAs voters prepare for the first-in-the-nation caucus and the first primary in New Hampshire, Buttigieg said his campaign has plans to step up outreach to voters.

       "  'authors': ['Fred Lucas'],\n",
       "  'text': \"The gears of impeachment whirred into action this week after Democrats seized on the revelations over President Trump’s push for Ukraine to probe the Bidens.\\n\\nAnd it shows no signs of slowing, driven by the release of the whistleblower complaint on Trump's July phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky and the transcript of the conversation, as well as anti-Trump lawmakers who have long sought to remove the president from office.\\n\\nGOP REP INTRODUCES RESOLUTION TO REMOVE NADLER AS JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN OVER IMPEACHMENT PROBE\\n\\nBut Republicans say another factor has helped drive this debate through the summer – an Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez-style primary challenge pulling the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee further left and pressuring him to throw the impeachment book at the president.\\n\\n“Is it really that hard to impeach such a lawless, corrupt president?” Lindsey Boylan, who is running against Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., in the Democratic primary, said in a recent campaign video.\\n\\nBoylan’s campaign is not responsible for the impeachment inquiry launched by Speaker Nancy Pelosi this week. While Nadler had already been leading one, to a degree, the Ukraine bombshell brought Pelosi on board.\\n\\nBut her primary campaign represents another wild card in the already-chaotic impeachment melee.\\n\\nAfter Pelosi’s announcement, Boylan cheered the move and immediately pressed for more, calling for a swiftly scheduled impeachment vote and investigations into everyone from Attorney General Bill Barr to Vice President Pence.\\n\\n“We have all the evidence we need to #ImpeachTrumpNOW. Articles must include #Ukraine, brazen human rights violations at the border, abuse of power, and obstruction of justice,” she tweeted.\\n\\nWith Pelosi’s announcement, Nadler is no longer the principal player in the impeachment drive. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., now assumes a more influential role. But Nadler’s committee will remain at the heart of any effort to draft and move impeachment articles. And his primary challenger is keeping up the pressure on him to follow through, something she’s been doing for months.\\n\\nHer weekend video took aim at Trump and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, asking: “And where are the Democratic leaders who swore an oath to defend the Constitution?”\\n\\nThe video was released just days after the House Judiciary Committee held what it called its first “impeachment hearing,” and as the controversy was first developing over Trump allegedly pushing Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and using U.S. aid as leverage.\\n\\nBoylan accused the establishment of “stalling and feeding us a bunch of B.S.” She added, “For too many of them, Donald Trump is a fundraising opportunity, not an existential threat to our democracy.”\\n\\nTrump hasn’t been a bad fundraising source for Boylan either. A longshot against 26-year incumbent Nadler, she managed to raise a surprising $264,657 in her first quarter by relentlessly hammering Nadler for not impeaching Trump already.\\n\\nBut that challenge – and the specter of an Ocasio-Cortez-style win over a Democratic powerhouse – could be having an impact.\\n\\nWhite House Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” alleged over the summer that Nadler was “falling over himself to become more and more progressive in order to try and keep his job and not lose to the next AOC.”\\n\\nNew York’s 10th congressional district includes the west side of Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn. Nadler was first elected in a special election in 1992. New York Democrats are reportedly considering moving what was scheduled to be a June 23 primary back to April 28 to coincide with the state’s presidential primary.\\n\\nNadler did not respond to requests for comment for this report. A New York Daily News report earlier this month, though, said Nadler suggested Boylan was only using impeachment as her rationale for running against him and insisted he’s been looking at impeachment since early this year.\\n\\nBoylan has been sharply critical of Nadler’s handling to date, telling a Yahoo News podcast last week that Nadler has “fumbled” impeachment by having a “muddled, elongated, prolonged process of nothingness.”\\n\\nThe 35-year-old challenger has something that Ocasio-Cortez didn’t in her 2018 primary victory shocker over then-House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley in New York’s 14th congressional district. Boylan, a former deputy secretary for economic development under New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, can cite government experience.\\n\\nBut the 14th district in 2018 and 10th district in 2020 aren’t entirely comparable, said Ester Fuchs, a resident of the 10th district and a Columbia University political science professor.\\n\\nCrowley lost a district to Ocasio-Cortez that was just 10 percent white. Nadler’s district is about 60 percent white, said Fuchs, also a former adviser to ex-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\\n\\nA big challenge in defeating Nadler, Fuchs said, is that despite his national profile, he is still very much a local politician.\\n\\n“Jerry Nadler shows up and doesn’t ignore his district. He comes to community meetings. He’s engaged at the neighborhood level,” Fuchs told Fox News.\\n\\nRecent polling indicates that while impeachment is a divisive issue for voters as a whole, it is popular among Democrats, the decisive force in a primary.\\n\\nStill, there’s no visible frustration over Nadler’s pace in the district, Fuchs said.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n“Anecdotally, people in this district seem proud their congressman is chairman of the Judiciary Committee and believe he’s handling the investigation of Trump responsibly,” Fuchs said.\\n\\nBoylan’s campaign initially responded to an inquiry from Fox News about an interview with the candidate for a statement for the story, but did not respond to subsequent inquiries.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard on Friday threw her weight behind House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\\'s Trump impeachment inquiry, reversing her opposition after the outcry this week over the whistleblower report on President Trump\\'s conversation with the president of Ukraine.\\n\\n“Up to this point, I have been opposed to pursuing impeachment because it will further divide our already badly divided country,\" the Hawaii congresswoman said in a press release.\\n\\nGabbard said she changed her mind this week.\\n\\n“However, after looking carefully at the transcript of the conversation with Ukraine’s President, the whistleblower complaint, the Inspector General memo, and President Trump’s comments about the issue, unfortunately, I believe that if we do not proceed with the inquiry, it will set a very dangerous precedent,\" she said. \"Future presidents, as well as anyone in positions of power in the government, will conclude that they can abuse their position for personal gain, without fear of accountability or consequences.\"\\n\\nPelosi, D-Calif., announced an official impeachment inquiry on Tuesday. Gabbard\\'s Friday statement aligned her with hundreds of other House Democrats in calling for impeachment but on the day of Pelosi\\'s announcement, she told Fox News that it would be too divisive for the country.\\n\\nTULSI GABBARD WON\\'T JOIN FELLOW DEMOCRATS\\' CALLS FOR IMPEACHMENT: IT WOULD BE \\'TERRIBLY DIVISIVE\\'\\n\\n\"I believe that impeachment at this juncture would be terribly divisive for the country at a time when we are already extremely divided. The hyperpartisanship is one of the main things driving our country apart,\" she said during an appearance on \"Fox & Friends.\"\\n\\nShe continued opposing impeachment on Wednesday after Trump released a rough transcript of his July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Although the transcript showed no explicit quid pro quo, House Democrats accused Trump of leveraging foreign aid as pressure for Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.\\n\\nGabbard responded by saying: \"I think most people reading through that transcript are not going to find that extremely compelling cause to throw out a president that won an election in 2016.\"\\n\\nHer Friday reversal came after Thursday testimony from acting Director of National Intelligence Joeseph Maguire, who defended the administration\\'s decision not to report the whistleblower complaint to the inspector general. And according to Maguire, the report was \"hearsay.\"\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nIt\\'s unclear which of Thursday\\'s revelations prompted Gabbard\\'s decision but she warned that the United States could become a \"banana republic\" without impeachment. “If we allow the president to abuse his or her power, then our society will rot from top to bottom. We will turn into a banana republic, where people in positions of power – from the president all the way down to the traffic cop – will feel it\\'s OK to abuse their power with no consequences,\" she said.\\n\\nShe added that Pelosi\\'s inquiry must be \"swift, thorough, and narrowly-focused. It cannot be turned into a long, protracted partisan circus that will further divide our country and undermine our democracy.”\\n\\nFox News\\' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.',\n",

Biden benefactors ready to mobilize mega PAC - A little on the nose, don’t you think?\\n\\n\\n\\nDEMS LOOK TO STREAMLINE IMPEACHMENT PROBE\\n\\nWaPo: “House Democratic leaders are eyeing a fast-paced investigation into the possible impeachment of President Trump, instructing the committees handling the probe to wrap up their findings within weeks in hopes of concluding before the holiday season. Multiple Democratic lawmakers and congressional aides said there is no formal timeline for the inquiry, but the ‘need for speed,’ as one aide put it, comes as Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is under pressure from vulnerable freshmen to keep the investigation narrowly focused and disciplined. The emerging strategy of a rapid investigation focused mainly on the accusation that Trump urged Ukraine’s president to dig up dirt about a political rival comes as lawmakers prepare to leave Washington for a two-week recess. … Pelosi and other leaders huddled in a basement conference room Thursday evening with more than a dozen ‘front-liner’ members representing the toughest districts for incumbent Democrats to discuss the fledgling probe and, in the words of multiple attendees, ‘get on the same page.’”\\n\\n\\n\\nTim Alberta: Will impeachment shatter a badly broken Congress? - Politico: “On Monday, [Rep. Abigail Spanberger] joined with six like-minded freshman colleagues in penning a Washington Post op-ed calling for an impeachment inquiry—stunning the Democratic caucus and effectively forcing Pelosi’s hand. It would be the unlikeliest bunch of members, legislative pacifists who had labored not to be defined by opposition to Trump, leading Congress into an era-defining clash. How the impeachment proceedings affect an increasingly polarized nation is anyone’s guess. But it’s hard to imagine the coming showdown doing any more damage to an institution that, lawmakers in both parties will agree, was broken long before Donald Trump came to town.”\\n\\n\\n\\nSnap poll shows impeachment supporters outnumber opponents - PBS: “Americans are split over whether they support an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, according to the latest poll from the PBS NewsHour, NPR and Marist. Forty-nine percent of U.S. adults said they supported the House of Representatives launching an impeachment inquiry into the president, while 46 percent of Americans said they disapproved, and 5 percent remained unsure, according to the poll. … Eighty-eight percent of Democrats agreed with the inquiry, along with 44 percent of independent voters, but among Republicans, support was drastically lower, at 6 percent. … This latest poll was conducted the day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for the House of Representatives to begin an impeachment inquiry…”\\n\\n\\n\\nKraushaar: Politics of impeachment now favor Democrats - National Journal: “The politics of impeachment is changing, rapidly. No one knows how this will end, but all signs are pointing to growing trouble for Republicans. The whistleblower’s well-documented allegation that Trump extorted Ukraine, an ally, for political gain is damning and direct. House Democrats are narrowly focused on digging deeper into the explosive evidence as the basis for impeachment. Administration officials connected to the alleged cover-up will be subpoenaed under oath before Congress as part of the impeachment hearings. If the White House thinks things will get better for them, they’re fooling themselves. … The larger reality is that public opinion is more fluid than anyone expected last week. Many anti-Trump pundits, expecting a repeat of our predictable tribal political realities, assumed that nothing has changed. But our politics has become so partisan that even rapid short-term movement suggests something is happening.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAndrew Cuomo mocks ‘leftist,’ ‘unproductive’ impeachment effort - New York Daily News: “Gov. Andrew Cuomo criticized ‘leftist’ Democrats for pushing Congress into launching an impeachment inquiry of President Trump and predicted the probe would lead to government gridlock. The governor derided the ‘quote unquote inquiry’ as the work of angry radicals who forced the hand of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to mount what he suggested would ultimately be an exercise in futility. ‘There is a heightened leftist component of the Democratic Party that she was feeling pressure from,’ Cuomo said. The governor ticked off a list of legislative priorities that would likely languish until after the 2020 elections now that he said Democrats will be focused on removing Trump from power. ‘It’s a long and unproductive road,’ Cuomo said. ‘Where does it go ultimately? Nowhere.’”\\n\\n\\n\\nTEAM TRUMP LEANS ON MUELLER MOVES\\n\\nAP: “The White House is dusting off its playbook from the special counsel’s Russia investigation. Caught off guard by the speed at which a whistleblower’s claims have morphed into an impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump and his team are scrambling to respond. They’re turning, at least for now, to some of the same strategies they used to counter special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. The basic tactics deployed by the short-staffed White House: Attempt to discredit government officials at the heart of the story. Dispatch Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and other allies to muddy the picture. Lean on Republicans in Congress to provide cover.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAmy Walter: Impeachment won’t change the game - Cook Political Report: “We are a deeply divided, deeply polarized country. Almost everything we do — from choosing where to eat lunch (Chick-fil-A vs. Whole Foods), to picking where to live (urban/suburban vs. rural/small town) is filtered through the lens of how we identify politically. As such, we shouldn't expect views of impeachment to be any different. Opinions won't swing wildly from day to day or week to week. We also shouldn't expect to see Americans overwhelming support or overwhelmingly oppose impeachment. Like everything in this era, the final verdict on impeachment is likely to be decided on the margins by voters who are holding conflicting views on the president and the process of impeachment. It will be decided by those who may dislike Trump, but are also frustrated by the paralysis in Washington, or those who may like the agenda of the president, but are troubled by his behavior.”\\n\\n\\n\\nRomney’s narrow road - NYT: “Mr. [Mitt] Romney’s public statements reflect what many in his party believe privately but are almost uniformly unwilling to say: that they are faced with damning revelations about the president that are difficult to explain away, and are unsure of whether there is more damaging material to come. What’s more, they are contending with a leader whose appetite for political payback for real or imagined slights is insatiable, and who is responding to the crisis with angry new threats and accusations that will only increase the pressure on them to choose a side. It amounts to an unenviable dilemma for Republicans at a consequential moment for the party. Any internal fractures over the next year could undermine both Mr. Trump’s re-election and Republican hopes for retaining their Senate majority and retaking the House.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst GOP governors come out in support of impeachment inquiry - WaPo: “For the first time, two Republican governors have publicly supported the impeachment inquiry of President Trump, a new development in an intensifying political fracas that has so far been largely partisan. Vermont Gov. Phil Scott and Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, both outspoken critics of Trump from the Northeast, said Thursday they favored the investigation, but Scott added that he would wait for more information before calling for further action against the president.”\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE RULEBOOK: *STANDING OVATION*\\n\\n“Ingratitude is a common topic of declamation against human nature; and it must be confessed that instances of it are but too frequent and flagrant, both in public and in private life.” – Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 57\\n\\n\\n\\nTIME OUT: MAN, HOLES\\n\\nUSA Today: “NASA has given us another historic glimpse into the wonders of space after releasing a video that shows a star-shredding black hole in a galaxy millions of light-years away. The amazing footage of the ‘cataclysmic phenomenon’ was taken by NASA’s planet-hunting Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS. Astronomers think the supermassive black hole weighs around 6 million times the sun’s mass and is located about 375 million light-years away in a galaxy of similar size to the Milky Way, NASA said. The incredible event, called a tidal disruption, is very rare and occurs once every 10,000 to 100,000 years in galaxies like the Milky Way. When a star gets too close, the intense tides of a black hole break apart the star into a stream of gas, according to NASA. As shown in the video, the tail of that stream breaks away from the black hole while other parts of it swing back around and create a halo of debris.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFlag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.\\n\\n\\n\\nSCOREBOARD\\n\\nDEMOCRATIC 2020 POWER RANKING\\n\\nBiden: 27.6 points (↓ 0.6 points from last wk.)\\n\\nWarren: 20.8 points (↑ 0.6 points from last wk.)\\n\\nSanders: 16 points (↑ 0.8 points from last wk.)\\n\\nHarris: 6.6 points (↓ 0.6 points from last wk.)\\n\\nButtigieg: 5.4 points (↑ 0.4 points from last wk.)\\n\\n[Averages include: Quinnipiac University, Fox News, NBC News/WSJ, CNN and ABC News/WaPo.]\\n\\n\\n\\nTRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE\\n\\nAverage approval: 43 percent\\n\\nAverage disapproval: 54 percent\\n\\nNet Score: -11 percent\\n\\nChange from one week ago: ↑ 0.4 points\\n\\n[Average includes: Quinnipiac University: 40% approve - 55% disapprove; Fox News: 45% approve - 54% disapprove; NBC News/WSJ: 45% approve - 53% disapprove; Gallup: 43% approve - 54% disapprove; CNN: 42% approve - 54% disapprove.]\\n\\n\\n\\nWANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\\n\\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

Biden Jr., concerned about his slipping poll numbers in the Democratic presidential primary and an onslaught of attacks from President Trump, are weighing whether to mobilize a super PAC supporting Mr. Biden and have held conversations with wealthy donors to gauge their interest in contributing money. Mr. Biden and his campaign aides have said since the start of the race that they would not welcome an outside spending effort on his behalf, and every other major Democratic candidate has sworn off super PACs for the duration of the primary. A spokesman for Mr. Biden on Thursday reiterated that he opposed super PACs and would reject any such group that attempted to support him. Yet several former staffers of Mr. Biden and political donors backing his candidacy have held conversations in recent weeks about moving ahead with a super PAC, and said Mr. Trump’s furious, and often unsubstantiated, allegations about the former vice president had convinced them it was imperative they act.”\\n\\n\\n\\nUnder fire, Biden looks to scamper left - WaPo: “Advisers to presidential candidate Joe Biden are weighing the introduction of a new tax on Wall Street, according to people familiar with the discussions, as the former vice president now stands alone among the Democratic presidential front-runners in not backing a multitrillion-dollar ‘wealth tax’ on the richest Americans. The plan under consideration from Biden’s advisers could tax financial transactions such as the sale of stocks and bonds, one of the people said. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Biden, under pressure throughout the presidential campaign to move left on a range of policy issues, has embraced several ideas to increase taxes on the rich and on corporations but so far has not gone as far as his two main rivals. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have each unveiled their own plans to impose a ‘wealth tax’ on multimillionaires and billionaires, with both also calling for significant new taxes on corporations and wealthy estates. Sanders unveiled his wealth tax earlier this week.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWall Street Democratic donors lay down the law on Warren - CNBC: “Democratic donors on Wall Street and in big business are preparing to sit out the presidential campaign fundraising cycle — or even back President Donald Trump — if Sen. Elizabeth Warren wins the party’s nomination. In recent weeks, CNBC spoke to several high-dollar Democratic donors and fundraisers in the business community and found that this opinion was becoming widely shared as Warren, an outspoken critic of big banks and corporations, gains momentum against Joe Biden in the 2020 race. ‘You’re in a box because you’re a Democrat and you’re thinking, ‘I want to help the party, but she’s going to hurt me, so I’m going to help President Trump,’’ said a senior private equity executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity in fear of retribution by party leaders.”\\n\\n\\n\\nA dozen candidates, one night for next Dem debate - Politico: “The Democratic National Committee intends to hold its fourth presidential primary debate on one night in October, packing the stage with as many as 12 qualified candidates. ‘To address several inquiries we have received we are writing to let you know that, pending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the DNC and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday October 15th,’ the DNC wrote in an email to campaigns on Friday.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\\n\\nN.Y. prosecutors, Trump lawyers reach deal on requests for Trump tax returns - WSJ\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump nominates Peter Gaynor to permanently head FEMA - AP\\n\\n\\n\\nSenate confirms Eugene Scalia as new secretary of Labor - Roll Call\\n\\n\\n\\nDisgraced former Health Secretary Tom Price seeks Senate appointment - Politico\\n\\n\\n\\nAUDIBLE: CLAWS OUT\\n\\n“This is a strain of cat that I don’t have the medical credentials to analyze nor the religious credentials to judge.” – Speaker Nancy Pelosi talking about President Trump with the New Yorker.\\n\\n\\n\\nANY GIVEN SUNDAY\\n\\nThis weekend Mr. Sunday will sit down with Rep.

The Hudson Regional Health Commission said they received two complaints in Jersey City and several complaints in Bayonne on Tuesday night. The HRHC confirmed a presence of an odor, but said the source could not be traced. Inspectors went into Newark - specifically to Raymound Boulevard and Doremus Avenue, because winds were coming from that direction. They were not successful in locating the origin. ‘It's not anything were used to around here. Being a peninsula, we have water on three sides and sometimes at low tide that you can smell the bay. It was really nothing like that. It was a very nasty, almost like a foul meat type of smell,’ OEM Coordinator Edoardo Ferrante said. The New Jersey DEP has been investigating the same odor since the beginning of summer.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…\\n\\n“But there is one area in which as a father I do feel a great weight of responsibility, a need to measure every word.
